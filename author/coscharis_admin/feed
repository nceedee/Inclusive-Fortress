										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The leading automobile Company, Coscharis Motors Plc recently introduced the All new Jaguar F-PACE at a media reveal in the Jaguar Land Rover showroom in Awoyaya, Lagos. It was a gathering of media partners to the Company across luxury and auto segments who became some of the first group of stakeholders to have a feel of the new vehicle in Nigeria.<br />
Setting the pace for the day was the opening remarks by the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group in person of Abiona Babarinde who officially welcomed all the media partners to the official unveil of the new Jaguar F-PACE. In his words, “we are delighted as the exclusive representative of the Jaguar Land Rover brand in Nigeria over the years to once again introduce the All New Jaguar F-PACE into the Nigeria market at this point in time. The luxury performance SUV brings together award-winning design, Jaguar performance and intuitive technologies to make every journey feel extraordinary.<br />
Riding on the acceptance of the SUV variant of the Jaguar brand by Nigerians gives us lots of confidence that this new Jaguar F-PACE will equally do well like the previous models. More importantly for Jaguar enthusiasts, Coscharis Motors aside from the unique aftersales deliverables that come with our Sales offerings, this time around has come up with series of vehicle finance schemes in partnership with reputable finance institutions including our sister firm, Coscharis Mobility to ease the purchase of this luxury item without much of financial stress. This scheme guarantees ownership with as low as 10% to 30% down payment of the principal amount of the vehicle and you are god to go with your dream vehicle”,<br />
Showcasing the unique selling propositions of the new Jaguar F Pace to the media team present, the Deputy General Manager, Sales for the Jaguar Land Rover brand, Ufuoma Umukoro said “the new Jaguar F-PACE which comes in two modes S and R- Dynamic, delivers a tranquil sanctuary for you and your passengers. Premium materials, new colourways and improved seat comfort are found throughout the all-new interior’’.<br />
The new F-PACE features an 8 speed automatic transmission with an improved torque and acceleration, CO2 emissions are reduced to 170g/km with fuel economy now down to 7.3/100km.The transmission and dynamics systems have also benefitted from incremental tweaks. You can choose between full dynamic performance and maximizing fuel economy. JaguarDrive Control performs gearshifts more quickly in Dynamic Mode and earlier up-shifts in Eco Mode. Rain, mud Mode switches to more gentle progress in low grip conditions. At the same time, F-PACE is now more comfortable and enjoyable to drive at a relaxed pace, without compromising its high-speed dynamics, further underlining the new model’s duality of purpose.<br />
He stated further that “for hassle-free repairs and replacements, customers can enjoy the reassurance of our standard five-year manufacturer’s warranty and five-year complimentary service, which is a first in the luxury segment”.<br />
The reveal event was rounded up with a facility tour of the Jaguar Land Rover workshop where the aftersales team delivers the ‘peace of mind’ for customers in maintaining their favorite luxury automobile.<br />
Further Upgrades<br />
DRIVING PERFORMANCE<br />
The steering system is enhanced with a new electronic power-assistance system delivering greater immediacy, providing a heightened connection between the vehicle and driver. Jaguar All-Wheel Drive with Intelligent Driveline Dynamics is a predictive all-wheel drive system. While others become active only after the car loses traction, our system pre-emptively shifts torque to the front wheels to maintain control and composure before grip is lost.<br />
EXTERIOR DESIGN<br />
The seamless bonnet, deeper grille, new double ‘J’ blade signature headlights and wider vents all add to Jaguar F PACE’s dynamic stance and on-road presence. The new integrated exhaust finishers compliment the redesigned rear bumper, further highlighting the purposeful stance.</p>
<p>INTERIOR PEACE, QUIET AND COMFORT</p>
<p>With Active road noise cancellation, thanks to the innovative technology from audio experts Meridian Audio7; reduced levels of vibration, F PACE’s newly redesigned interior features Luxtec or leather wrapped surfaces offers an improved ride comfort.</p>
<p>WIRELESS CHARGING<br />
Optional wireless device charging with phone signal booster lets you charge compatible smartphones without the need for wires or a charging dock. While in the car, your phone will use the vehicle’s antenna for improved signal and clearer calls.<br />
DRIVER ASSISTANCE<br />
Jaguar F-PACE has been built with driver assistance features that help make getting around town and parking easier, and driving on motorways more enjoyable. These technologies enhance your drive by helping to take the stress out of it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Foremost automobile company and sole distributor of Renault brand in Nigeria, Coscharis Motors Plc, has announced mouth-watering offers for its Renault customers throughout the month of April, in the spirit of the Easter celebrations. <strong>These giveaways include, free ABRO Generator, 5% price discount, free insurance, free vehicle registration and first 2 services free of charge.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Announcing these offerings, Felix Mahan, the Brand Manager, Renault at Coscharis Motors said, “We are excited to offer this bumper Easter giveaways to our Renault customers; It is our special way of welcoming new customers to own a brand new Renault vehicle with lots of other juicy products which include a brand new Abro generator. This equally extends to existing Renault customers who may wish to trade-in their current cars for the latest models of the French made vehicles”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Easter giveaway offering is available on the Renault Kwid and Koleos only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the same vein, Abiona Babarinde, the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group posited that the Easter festive period was chosen specifically to encourage numerous stakeholders towards purchasing both the Renault Kwid and Koleos. Babarinde said, “Since we took over the responsibility of representing the respected French brand in Nigeria, we felt it will not be a bad idea to use this festive period of Easter to delight our numerous stakeholders who will be discerning to own a brand new vehicle during this period. The good thing about this special campaign is that it is open to both existing owners of the Renault brand and others that are yet to have a feel of this iconic French brand. Again, aside the mouth offering giveaways, Coscharis as the exclusive franchise owner of the brand in Nigeria promises to deliver the total brand experience beyond just the new purchase. We are equipped with the original parts, right tools to fix the original parts and the certified Renault technicians to deliver your total aftersales experience throughout our workshop outlets located in all the six geo – political zones in Nigeria”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RENAULT KWID</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Renault Kwid is a compact car with the robustness and look of an SUV. It brings together the practicality of a compact car with the specifications of a genuine SUV: a sturdy and striking design, as well as economy and technological advances. Besides, its front grille, 14” wheel rims and door mirror shells give it a distinctive look when compared to other cars in its class.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-220089 alignright" src="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Kwid-1024x653.png" alt="" width="640" height="408" srcset="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Kwid-1024x653.png 1024w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Kwid-300x191.png 300w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Kwid-768x490.png 768w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Kwid.png 1127w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Renault KWID’s interior space is a masterful blend of modernity and ergonomics. The car is roomy and comfortable for driver and passengers alike. And, for added convenience, Renault KWID is equipped with numerous storage spaces and a spacious boot (290 litres), making day-to-day life easier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>RENAULT KOLEOS</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Renault Koleos is an SUV specially designed to broaden your outlook. An unprecedented combination of power and refinement, its assertive design pushes the boundaries of what is expected and expresses itself with bold style. Its confident stature commands respect. An SUV with broad shoulders and muscular side panels, its robust front end, broad tyres and large wheelbase give it the look of a partner that can rise to any challenge. The Renault Koleos takes you further, whichever path you take, whatever your quest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Renault Koleos can be described as the art of drawing attention. It embodies new aspirations. Charismatic, with a sense of detail and personality enhanced by its sleek appearance and athletic curves. Everything in the Koleos is designed for your driving pleasure. The ergonomics of the centre console, which puts the main controls at your fingertips, the technologies controlled by the R-LINK 2 multimedia system with its 8.7-inch touchscreen, the personalisation of the TFT instrument panel and the innovative driver assistance tools all help create an unprecedented experience combining pleasure and ease on board.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-220088 alignleft" src="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Koleos-1024x608.png" alt="" width="640" height="380" srcset="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Koleos-1024x608.png 1024w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Koleos-300x178.png 300w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Koleos-768x456.png 768w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Renault-Koleos.png 1231w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The design of the Koleos and the choice of materials will meet all of your expectations. The finish of the overstitched leather, the satin finish of the chrome inserts and the immaculate trim of the doors provide a level of comfort that is worthy of a large saloon. The grab handles on either side of the centre console and the raised driving position let you know that you are in a real SUV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Koleos allows you to immerse yourself in a rich acoustic experience, as intense as a live concert, with the Bose® audio system. Configure the features of the large, connected R-LINK 2 touch screen, taking full control of the vehicle, multimedia, navigation, telephone and driving assistance functions. The generous amount of space has been dedicated to your comfort and that of your passengers. Your seat hugs you whilst the sunroof opens up new perspectives. You experience the spirit of adventure that comes with SUVs from the comfort of your “cocoon”, both in front and in the rear. To make your life easier, Renault has fitted the New Koleos with Remote Engine Start. Programme it with the time that you want your vehicle to start and by the time you step into your car, the temperature inside will be perfect. Welcome to a new kind of comfort with programmable settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drive the New Koleos and experience the e­ffect of its all-terrain ALL MODE 4&#215;4-i technology; its engine, connected to its new X-Tronic gearbox; and its numerous driver assistance technologies—not to mention the unique quality of its Bose® sound system. It’s the kind of performance that will always take you further, be it on an urban adventure or o­ the beaten track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two variants of the Renault Koleos available in the Nigerian market to select from, ZEN which is the 2WD CVT, 5 speed automatic transmission and INTENSE, which is the 4WD CVT, 5 speed automatic transmission.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coscharis Motors Plc has announced exclusive offers for its range of auto products for the entire period of Easter. These offers range from favourable pricing, giveaways, complementary insurance, registration and services.</p>
<p>In his words, the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group, Abiona Babarinde, “existing customers and new customers now have the opportunity to drive away either the Jaguar, Land Rover, BMW, Ford or Renault variants with ad-on during this Easter period. This is another way of appreciating our numerous loyal customers who have been consistent with their patronage over the years to enjoy this special offerings to celebrate the Easter festive season. Also, as a way of cultivating new customers, we are equally extending this package to accommodate all our hot prospects alike to own any of our iconic brands with ease”.</p>
<p>Price offers ranges from 5% upwards across the brands, every Renault (Kwid &amp; Koleos) purchase comes with a free Abro generator while Jaguar Land Rover offers a complementary 5 years warranty and 5 years free service including special pricing for the Jaguar E Pace.&nbsp; It is important to note that these offers are only valid while stocks last. Major price slashes are offered for the Ford Escape, BMW X4, 4 and 3 series amongst others.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coscharis&nbsp;</span>Motors Plc, a foremost automobile dealer and sole distributor of Ford vehicles in Nigeria is offering free service to her customers who purchase&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">a brand new Ford car.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although, itself still reeling from the effect of the global economic doldrums caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, Coscharis Motors Plc still finds it expedient to support her Ford customers in their drive towards navigating out of the economic recession. This, the auto dealer hopes to achieve through her Free Service Pack offer. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Announcing the offer, Felix Mahan who is the Brand Manager, Ford, at Coscharis Motors said, “This is our token to support our teaming Ford customers by minimizing</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-213010 aligncenter" src="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford-Strip2-1024x461.png" alt="" width="785" height="353" srcset="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford-Strip2-1024x461.png 1024w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford-Strip2-300x135.png 300w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford-Strip2-768x346.png 768w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford-Strip2.png 1489w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;the cost of vehicle ownership for those who have refused to buckle under the weight of the global economic recession, occasioned by the Covid-19 pandemic, but have resolved to go further and vie for opportunities to help pull their businesses and by extension our nation, out of the proverbial economic woods.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The free service offer is available at all Coscharis Motors Plc showrooms and offices spread throughout the country and all Quick Lane centers alike. The promo which started on September 1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is valid till December 31</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">st</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2020. Any customer who purchases a brand new Ford car from Coscharis Motors during the promo period gets a free service pack which covers vehicle service parts and labour, for 12 months or 16,000 kilometers, whichever comes first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mahan further said, “At Coscharis Motors, we don’t just sell the car, we back it up with world class after-sales service. All our service centers are manned by certified professional technicians equipped with latest tools and using only genuine OEM parts and lubricants. These are the people who will administer this free service offer and other services as required by our valued customers, to keep their vehicle working optimally throughout its life span.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is not the first time that Coscharis is supporting her new car customers with free after-sales services. Recall that in the recent past, Coscharis offered her customers a free service pack called Extended Service Plan (ESP) which offered free service for four years or 120,000km. The ESP helped many Ford owners to drastically minimize the cost of ownership of their Ford cars in those days. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coscharis Group recently upgraded its Corporate and Brand Portfolio’s digital platforms in order to reposition its mode of doing business now and in the nearest future especially given business trends in the post COVID 19 era in Nigeria. Subsequently, the company has broadened its social media channels and interactivity of its respective websites to be more customer-centric.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Group’s objective is to bridge the gap that is being created by the expectation that a chunk of our business relationship management will be transacted through digital strategies going forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Abiona Babarinde, General Manager, Marketing &amp; Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group, it is imperative that any business planning to remain relevant must key into the digital divide especially to be able to reach the growing aspiration generation on the one hand and the now teeming target market traversing into the digital platform given the COVID-19 saga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the General Manager stated that these channels are geared toward enabling customers, prospects, and aspirers to engage with our brands from the comfort of their homes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To ensure engagement, the self-help feature has been upgraded on the corporate website to enable visitors remotely reach out to us and receive immediate feedback. In addition, each brand now has its bespoke website aside the Coscharis group website. This makes tailored searches easier especially since you can link back and forth from the website to the social media page.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customers, prospects and aspirers are encouraged to follow these handles as we intend to push a lot of sales, service and lifestyle offers via these platforms.&nbsp;“It is an opportunity for followers to get fresh updates and rewards from our respective brands as well as useful management insights from the President of Coscharis Group, Dr Cosmas Maduka.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the market positioning of our brands, we have also discovered that there are so many misleading and fraudulent social media handles related to these brands, hence </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the organization</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">has decided to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">update all its</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> official accounts on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For purposes of accuracy you can follow us on @Coscharis_Group, @Landrover_NG, @JaguarNG, @BMW_NG, @Quicklaneng, @Ford_Coscharis, @renaultnigeria, @rollsroycecarslagos.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Sequel to Dr Cosmas Maduka’s emergence as the winner of Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2020 award for the West Africa region, he officially joined the “EY World Entrepreneur of the Year” Class of 2020 along with 46 other exceptional entrepreneurs from 41 countries across the globe.</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-200528 alignleft" src="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ey-forza-1024x541.png" alt="" width="640" height="338" srcset="https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ey-forza-1024x541.png 1024w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ey-forza-300x159.png 300w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ey-forza-768x406.png 768w, https://coscharisgroup.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ey-forza.png 1602w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>The global event, originally scheduled to hold as a live audience participatory event in Carlo, Monaco, held as a first ever live virtual EY award ceremony in partnership with CNBC due to the travel restrictions occasioned by the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic across the world.</p>
<p>The award is not only designed to celebrate and honour the contributions and achievements of successful entrepreneurs but also serves to inspire today’s successful entrepreneurs, so they can share their incredible entrepreneurial stories stated Ashish Bakhshi, Leader at EY (West Africa).</p>
<p>While Dr. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw from India, emerged the global stage award winner, Dr Maduka was acclaimed to have made the top list of the highest ranked award winners in EY’s People’s Choice with viewers reaching 1.7m across 124 countries and still growing as at the award day. According to Stasia Mitchell, Entrepreneurship Leader at EY (Global Growth Markets), “this was the first time we asked the people to vote on the award winner who most inspired them. The voting was meant to be a fun, engaging way to get to know the class of 2020 better”.</p>
<p>He stated further it was no surprise that Dr Maduka and the Coscharis brand stood out so clearly. “This continues to show how inspiring you and your story are to so many around the world and it says a lot about how valuable your mission is. I can’t wait to meet you in person.”</p>
<p>An obviously elated Dr. Cosmas Maduka, President/CEO Coscharis Group, says, “I have utmost respect for all the finalists from different countries because each of us has a unique story to tell that resonates&nbsp;with the audience. It must have been a very difficult journey for the judges to arrive at their decision and we have to respect it because they have their criteria set. At the end of the day, if I had a choice, I would have given the global award to Dr. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw still like the judges did.&nbsp; It is really not easy to contend among men and she must have done something much better than the rest of us that stood her out in the mind of the judges.&nbsp; I therefore congratulate her and all the finalists this year.”</p>
