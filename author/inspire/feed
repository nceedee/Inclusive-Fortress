										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Leading automobile dealership in Nigeria, Coscharis Motors Plc, a subsidiary of Coscharis Group and the exclusive franchisee of the Ford brand in Nigeria excited automobile enthusiasts and customers at the recently held 2023 Lagos Motor Fair and Autoparts Expo, which took place at the Federal Palace Hotel, Lagos. Coscharis’s participation at this edition of the auto fair similar to the past editions was in a bid to ensure that the Ford showroom is brought closer to customers and enthusiasts, thereby availing them the opportunity to interact with the latest Ford products in the market.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">Speaking at the fair ground, Abiona Babarinde, General Manager, Marketing &amp; Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group said, “We are excited to showcase these variants of our Ford brand at this year’s Motor Fair to the delight of everyone that visited our stand; most especially the Ranger 4&#215;2 single cabin, assembled here in Nigeria at our ultra-modern auto assembly plant in Awoyaya, Lagos. Also on display here at the fair ground are the iconic Ford Explorer, Ford Edge and the recently introduced Ford Bronco respectively with guaranteed warranties that comes with the purchase of any of these variants to the delight of numerous visitors to our stand. Part of the take away during the fair was the finance scheme package in collaboration with some of our reputable financial institutions including one of our sister companies (Coscharis Mobility) together with a robust insurance cover by our insurance partners (Tangerine and AIICO insurance) firms respectively. You will agree with us that all these delivers a comprehensive soft landing for both existing customers and prospects alike to keep enjoying their favourite Ford vehicles they can now afford”. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1">“We also want to seize this opportunity to wet our customers’ appetite by informing them about the All-New Ford Territory, which is soon to debut officially in Nigeria. The all-new Ford Territory which is built for young, smart, and connected customers has a modern design and advanced technology features that deliver a highly exciting and progressive customer experience. Look out for it, it’s coming soon.”</p>
<p class="p1"><b>BRONCO</b></p>
<p class="p1">Ford Bronco is a multi-terrain navigator powered by optional 2.3L Ecoboost or 2.7L Ecoboost engines. The Bronco was launched into the Nigerian market by Coscharis Motors at last year’s edition of the Motor Fair. It offers a Terrain Management System with G.O.A.T. Modes (Go Over Any Type of Terrain). These driving modes give you the ability to match performance to the terrain, weather, or whatever the roads and trails throw your way, at the simple turn of a dial.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>EXPLORER</b></p>
<p class="p1">The name says it all: Explorer. And it does just that – empowering adventure-seekers and active families to pack up their gear, load up the gang, and head out. When the Explorer and Explorer Sport debuted 3 decades ago, these category-defining vehicles created a new way to travel. The current version of Explorer SUV offers a spacious interior with increased cargo space compared to the previous generation. With seating for 7, passengers in all 3 rows will benefit. The Explorer has generous1st- and 2nd-row hip room and 2nd-row head room, while 3rd-row passengers enjoy spacious head room. Should someone in the 2nd or 3rd row unbuckle their safety belt, the safety belt usage sensors will alert the driver through the instrument cluster productivity screen. And thanks to a dual-wall dashboard between the engine and passenger compartment, as well as acoustic glass for the windshield and 1st-row windows, everyone will enjoy the Explorer cabin.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>EDGE</b></p>
<p class="p1">The Ford Edge, which is another vehicle on display at the motor fair is defined by modern sophistication. Athletic new front and rear styling reaches its ultimate expression – an exhilarating 250 horsepower of performance-enhanced pleasure. There are plenty of smart new features as well.</p>
<p class="p1">Starting with Ford Co-Pilot360, a suite of standard driver-assist technologies designed to help you confidently navigate your world. A smooth-shifting rotary gearshift dial that puts you in control of the 8-speed automatic transmission. A wireless charging pad that makes recharging your mobile phone hassle-free. And a B&amp;O Sound System with 12 high-performance speakers. Now more than ever, it’s easy to keep your edge.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Go further</b></p>
<p class="p1">You can go further with the Ford Protect which offers a holistic suite of service, maintenance, warranty and roadside-assistance products aimed at keeping the vehicle in perfect working condition in addition to a 3-yr/100 000km Comprehensive Warranty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>About Us</b></p>
<p class="p1">Coscharis Motors Plc has the exclusive franchise for Ford brands in Nigeria with Ford dedicated sales showrooms, parts and service workshops in all the six geopolitical zones.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coscharis Motors Plc, the exclusive representative of the iconic French automobile brand, Renault vehicles in Nigeria gave members and friends of the late Golf buff, Chief Luke Uche Okpuno a memorable experience of the French brand during the recently held memorial tournament at the Ibori Golf and Country Club in Asaba, Delta State.</p>
<p>The major highlight of the tournament was the sponsorship of the Hole-In-One prize of a Renault Duster donated by Coscharis Motors Plc. This expectedly raised the bar of the tournament with both the Pros and others that participated aiming at going home with the star prize but unfortunately, it was a tall order for any of the golfers that participated to hit the hole in one but ultimately it still created the real fun of the game for all the participants.</p>
<p>In his words, Abiona Babarinde, General Manager, Marketing &amp;amp; Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group who represented the sponsor, he said “our sponsorship of this tournament with a Renault Duster for the Hole-In-One prize amongst other donations made towards the success story of the tournament was to first and foremost celebrate a loyal customer of Coscharis in his lifetime in person of late Chief Luke Uche Okpuno and to do that is to key into his favourite sport of Golf when he was alive. Likewise to be able to create an avenue for his family, friends and well-wishers to come together for a tournament like this in his honour to unwind with the game of golf and at the same time have the opportunity to aspire to own any of the brand new Renault vehicles on display aside the one for the star prize”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the coordinator of the tournament who happened to be the junior brother to late Chief Okpuno in person of Honourable Gabriel Okpuno while speaking at the closing ceremony, showered so much encomium on Coscharis as a brand for the support towards a success story of a dream come true (the tournament) to honour his late brother with a sport he loved so much during his lifetime. He further stated that his wish, the entire family together with the leadership and members of Ibori Golf &amp;amp; Country Club, Asaba is to immortalise Chief Okpuno’ s name with a yearly tournament in his memory with the prayer that a reputable brand like Coscharis will continue to back them up with their sponsorship support like they did this year.</p>
<p>The one week tournament that started on March 20 th ended on a very exciting happy note on March 25 th with a well packaged dinner and prize giving ceremony to various participants that won in different categories of the tournament. The Captain of the Club, Surveyor Jimmy Odogwu thanked everyone that participated especially the sponsors led by Coscharis Motors Plc that presented the star prize of Hole-In-One. The prize giving segment ended with the announcement of the overall winner in person of Mr. Collins Oseh.</p>

<li class="li1"><b>Nigeria is the sixth market in the Sub-Sahara region to announce a formal INEOS Grenadier sales and service site; more to follow over the next few months</b></li>
<li class="li1"><b>The INEOS Grenadier is a rugged and uncompromising off-roader, built from the ground up to meet the most extreme demands of customers</b></li>
<li class="li1"><b>The Grenadier has undergone extensive testing across Sub-Sahara Africa and is perfectly at home in Nigeria</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">INEOS Automotive </span>has named Coscharis Motors<span class="s2"> as its official retail partner in Nigeria. </span>The country is now the sixth market in Sub-Sahara Africa to join the INEOS Automotive brand, following <span class="s2">South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia and Botswana.</span></p>
<p class="p3">“We are carefully selecting our partners across the SSA region, to find people who know their local market and customers, and also understand our brand,” said Tim Abbott, INEOS Automotive Head of Region South Africa and Sub-Sahara Africa. “Coscharis Motors shares our belief that the INEOS Grenadier is the perfect vehicle not only for Nigeria, but for the continent. Our shared passion for off-roading, along with their excellent reputation in the automotive industry, makes it the perfect partnership for Grenadier in Nigeria.”</p>
<p class="p3">Commenting on this partnership, the President / CEO of Coscharis Group, Dr. Cosmas Maduka said: “We are proud that INEOS Automotive has appointed Coscharis Motors to represent its brand in Nigeria. This milestone marks another step in the evolution of our company. With our history and experience of the Nigerian market, we know that the INEOS Grenadier is going to be a serious player in the off-road segment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p3">“We have no doubt that the Grenadier has what it takes to handle Africa’s tough terrain and that it is the perfect option to meet the specific demands of those who need a capable, refined, and reliable off-road vehicle in the region. We look forward to the first customer test drives and hearing public feedback, because this vehicle is definitely going to stir things up in Nigeria,” added Dr. Maduka.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Award-winning engines</b></p>
<p class="p3">The Grenadier has been developed to be refined on the road and extraordinarily capable off-road. The Grenadier is powered by a choice of two straight-six, 3.0-litre BMW engines. Both the BMW B57 diesel and B58 petrol powertrains have a proven track record, regularly appearing in top ten world’s best engine lists since 2016. They have been used in everything from sports cars to SUVs.</p>
<p class="p3">The two power units bring BMW’s sophistication and refinement to the Grenadier, but they have been enhanced by INEOS Automotive’s engineering team. As well as providing powerful acceleration on tarmac, they also deliver peak torque at low revs – sustaining it through the rev range – for optimal off-road performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">The carefully calibrated characteristics help the driver to confidently manage the vehicle’s momentum and grip without stressing the engine, ensuring full control when tackling tricky terrain. The refined turbo petrol engine produces 286PS (210kW) and 450Nm (332 lb ft) of torque, while the twin-turbo diesel generates 249PS (183kW) and 550Nm (406 lb ft), for even greater pulling power. Start/stop is built-in, increasing range and preserving air quality when the vehicle is stationary.</p>
<p class="p1">While it’s every inch a rugged 4X4, it ticks all the right boxes on the road, too. The chassis combines a five-link suspension setup with Brembo brakes and Bridgestone tyres, meaning the Grenadier is composed, well- mannered and fun to drive no matter what the terrain.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>Global and local network</b></p>
<p class="p1">By the end of this year INEOS Automotive plans to have a network of more than 200 sales and service sites for the Grenadier spanning over 50 countries, including established dealer groups, 4X4 specialists and agricultural equipment dealers.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p1">Now that the agreement with INEOS Automotive has been signed, Coscharis Motors will focus on readying its dedicated Grenadier showroom in Victoria Island, Lagos. The first Grenadier demonstrator vehicles are expected to arrive in Nigeria in early 2023 with customer deliveries expected to commence within the first quarter. All aftersales servicing will be conducted at a dedicated workshop also located in Lagos.</p>
<p class="p1">The INEOS Grenadier was created to fulfil the vision of adventurer and INEOS Group Chairman, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, inspired by legendary working 4X4s. The Grenadier is a rugged and uncompromising off-roader, designed to be a capable, durable, and reliable working tool to conquer the world’s harshest environments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">It was another brilliant outing for one of the leading auto giant in Nigeria, Coscahris Motors Plc through its local assembly arm of the business, Coscharis Assembly Plant as it carted home the award of the <b>Outstanding Auto Assembling Company of the Year</b> at this years’ Marketing Edge 10<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> anniversary Summit and Awards held recently in Lagos.</p>
<p class="p1">Coscharis Assembly Plant which is a Semi – Knocked Down (SKD) plant located at the group head office of Coscharis Group at Awoyaya, Lagos currently assembles iconic brands like the Ford and Renault. Specifically, the plant assembles the Ford Ranger, Renault Duster and Logan respectively.</p>
<p class="p1">Receiving the award on behalf of the Company, the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group, Abiona Babarinde dedicated the award to customers that believed in the locally assembled vehicles produced from the plant with their patronage over the years. In his words, “this award is to reconfirm the pedigree of Coscharis Motors as a leading player to reckon with when it comes to setting standards in the automotive industry in Nigeria. This is another confirmation and endorsement by the marketing media sector as pace setter of Coscharis’ positive contribution to the growth of the automotive industry in Nigeria. This award is dedicated to all our numerous customers for their patronage and also to our partners (Ford and Renault brands) for believing in us to deliver locally assembled vehicles in our country that meets the global standard of their various brands”.</p>
<p class="p1">The Coscharis Assembling Plant remains one of the surviving local assembly plants in Nigeria despite the challenging business environment. The Company has resolved to turn all the challenges to opportunities in delivering local contents by way of setting standards when it comes to local assembling of respected automobile brands in Nigeria for Nigerians at affordable prices without compromising the global standard and quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><b>About Coscharis Motors Assembly Plant</b></p>
<p class="p1">Coscharis Motors Plc started the assembly of Semi –Knocked Down (SKD) vehicles in 2015 when the Nigeria government introduced the New Automotive Policy. It started temporarily at their Ikeja facility with JoyLong buses which is an eighteen seater bus and Ford Ranger which are pickups of 4&#215;4 double cabin, 4&#215;2 double cabin and 4&#215;2 single cabin respectively. It was later moved to the ultra-modern main Plant located at the Group head office, Awoyaya, Lekki – Epe Expressway, Lagos in the year 2017; when they included Renault Duster 4&#215;4, 4&#215;2 SUV and also Renault Logan which is a saloon car. The production capacity of the main assembly plant stands at about 90 vehicles per day but the current production has painfully been reduced to about 10 vehicles per day which is due to so many factors like lack of conducive business environment, lack of infrastructure, inconsistent policy support, low patronage of locally assembled vehicles in Nigeria amongst others. Staff strength for the Assembly plant is 86 (74 Nigerians and 12 expatriates). There are aftersales facilities for the brands in all the major cities of the country where original parts from partner OEMs are stocked.</p>
<p class="p1">At full capacity running, the assembly plant will be able to fill in the gap of imported used vehicles into the country and by extension influence the delivery of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) in the automotive industry with other brands opening similar plants like we presently experience in South Africa with a better conducive business environment. Taking into consideration the multiple expected implication of generating more employment and opportunities for Nigerians to own cheaper vehicles that are produced specifically for the terrain with the ready market advantage of over 200million population.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the rainy season can be frustrating for road users, especially car owners, due to bad roads, traffic jams, and constant waterlogs. Unfortunately, the bad roads and drainage systems do not make it easy for vehicle owners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of these challenges, there are several precautions you can take to maintain and preserve the value and longevity of your vehicle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These safety precautions are guaranteed to keep yourself, passengers, other road users, and your car safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Fix or Change your wiper</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wiper is frequent during the rainy season, unlike the dry season, where it is not used frequently. It is essential to check your wiper because it is made of rubber which can wear out quickly. It can result in scratches or uneven cleaning of the windshield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct the airconditioner flow to your windshield to reduce the appearance of fog to enhance visibility</span></p>
<p><b>BONUS POINT: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your wiper liquid filled to the brim</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Check your headlight and Tailights</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear visual is your primary goal during this period, although the heavy downpour can make this a challenge. But, with your headlight and taillight in good condition, you are good to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunlight causes your headlamps to get cloudy; this is why regular cleaning is vital to maintain its proper function.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check for cracks and breakages to ensure water does not enter the headlights and cause unwanted fuses. If your light flickers when it is turned on, this is most likely a sign of changing its bulb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Check your batteries</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car battery issues are usually the most frequent problem motorists face during the rainy period leaving motorists stranded due to humidity and droplets splashing during this time. Therefore, if there is a greenish white powdery around the terminal of the battery, this is a sign of corrosion which can make the power to the car unstable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can leave the car hood open to avoid direct heat damage to the battery. Although a radiator helps cool down the system, leaving the car hood open makes the cooling process faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Check your car brakes</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there are any unusual sounds while braking, it is crucial to get it checked and fixed by professionals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, During the rainy period, brakes take a while to work adequately because water reduces friction between the tires and the road, which does not allow the car to stop at the appropriate time. This means overspeeding should be avoided to protect yourself and other road users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Line Car Floor with Plastic Footmat of Old Newspaper</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plastic foot mat or newspaper can save the stress of maintaining the vehicle&#8217;s interior from mud, moisture, and the damp smell, which is usually challenging to eliminate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Other Tips</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll windows up</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry spares, e.g., tires, battery, fuse, cables, etc</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain proper distance from vehicles ahead of you</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use headlights and taillights for better visual</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of using starch on clothes is to give them a crisp and clean appearance. Spray starch is usually applied during the ironing process, which is easier. However, a downside to regular starch usage is that it reduces clothing life by breaking down the fabric. Two fabrics are not advisable to use Spray starch on</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Silk:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid spray starch as it can result in a starch spot on the fabric and make it unnaturally hard.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Linen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid using starch as it can make the fabric unnecessarily hard.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Spray Starch works better with cotton and cotton blend fabrics. Let’s delve into clothes Spray Starch works best for.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Dress Pants: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crease is visible down the middle of both legs. Spray Starch helps maintain the crease over time. Spray the starch on the crease, let it absorb into the fabric and iron in medium heat.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Dress Shirts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice, the dress shirt collar loses its shape over time due to laundering. But, this is where the Spray Starch works best to prevent the collar from falling flat.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BONUS TIP</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always make sure your cloth is clean before application of Spray starch</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron the fabric on medium heat to seal the starch into the material.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using Spray starch regularly and use a minimal quantity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray Starch works best with cotton and cotton blend materials.</span></li>
</ul>
