From an ominous brown color stain on the fender or at the edges of your car, they can lowers the value of your car by eating away at the structure, ruining its functionality and costing you some money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This unsightly ugly color unfortunately forms much more quickly than they are removed: with oxygen, water and road salt combining at the surface of any aspect of your car, they form, signifying the breakdown of iron-based materials on such a surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several kinds of rust that can develop on your car\u2019s edges and surfaces. Surface rusts are likely to form when your car is constantly exposed to the Sun\u2019s UV rays. Such exposure has the tendency to break down your car\u2019s paint over time. Damages such as scratches, scrapes, dents and even bird droppings can make your car rust. In this instance, surface rust are removed using high-grade sandpaper or an abrasive wheel to grind it down until the paint and rust are gone, and shiny metal is exposed<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when this rust is left untreated, it begins to expand and continues going deeper, creating \u201cscales\u201d and exposing the metal underneath and leaving holes in your car. Unfortunately, at this point, every option for correcting the problem won\u2019t have an effective result. In most cases, you\u2019ll need to have the entire panel replaced or have the corroded areas cut out and have patch panels welded into place. If the frame of your car is rusted, this will damage its structural integrity, making it unsafe to drive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, rusts can be largely avoidable. All you have to do is know how to prevent it effectively so you don\u2019t waste money, time or get frustrated.
