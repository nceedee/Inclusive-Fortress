They are difficult to wipe off and can be tricky to clean. Grease stains affect any part of the kitchen like the walls, your cookware, kitchen utensils, oven or grill, plates, kitchen napkins.&nbsp; They may also stain your sinks and taps from splash accidents while cleaning kitchen utensils. Outside vegetarian, grease stains will be commonplace as it&#8217;s associated with staple food items such as soy sauce, mayonnaise, butter, bacon, fat, ham, etc, so understanding techniques for handling them is knowledge that can be very handy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It can be tough to get grease stains off any item in the kitchen. This is because water alone will not remove grease seeing that water molecules do not adhere to grease molecules. Human muscle and dedication alone are unfortunately not always enough to remove caked grease from a well-used kitchen. Commercial grease cleaners like our Abro oven and grill cleaner can handle most messes, but what else can you do if you cannot afford any products at the moment? Fortunately, there are ways to combat grease stains using items you already have around the house. These are the top five home remedies for removing kitchen grease below.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Lemon, ash, and vinegar<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The acidity of the lemon and vinegar will help to break down the grease stains. If oil stains have been allowed to fester and harden,&nbsp; lime and vinegar will dissolve the surface due to &nbsp; their acidity. Ash, especially wood ash, contains lye which when smeared on grease dries it up and cuts it off leaving your surfaces good as new.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making a paste of ash, lemon, and vinegar is the simplest way to restore the luster of your copper vessels. Now rub this paste all over the vessels and wash them in hot water. For best results, leave the utensil in the paste for 2-3 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Laundry Detergent in Liquid Form<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Liquid laundry detergent is another good solution for cleaning oil and grease stains because it contains various chemicals and properties created expressly to breakfor the purpose of breaking down oil and stripstripping it off materials. When you use liquid detergent on greasy surfaces it cleans the oil off effortlessly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Much like with dish soaps, sprinkle a generous amount of detergent onto the object and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. If the stain is on clothing, leave the detergent on the item while loading it into the washing machine for extra cleaning. If you are attempting to remove stains from upholstery, this is a great method to try before attempting to clean it with harsh chemicals that may ruin it, because laundry detergent is gentle while still very effective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Salt and Rubbing Alcohol Solution<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dehydrating properties of Salt work to dry up oil and lift it off materials while rubbing alcohol breaks down oil and causes it to evaporate from materials. Alcohol dries almost instantly so you don&#8217;t have to worry about leaving a wet stain.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Application<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is simple to know what to do if grease gets on your shirt or other clothing items, but kitchens can contain other types of fabrics that cannot be washed. For non-washable fabrics such as rugs, chair covers, and carpets, mix 1 cup of salt with four portions of rubbing alcohol (you can use measuring cups or spoons to measure it out). Rub the solution on the stain with a cloth until it lifts off with the cloth. After the grease has been removed and your solution has dried, sweep away the excess salt and wipe away any salt marks with a damp cloth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Baking Soda and water<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Baking soda can be used to clean up stubborn grease stains on walls, cookware, clothes, and utensils. Baking soda works wonders with cleaning grease because it is a mild alkali that causes dirt and grease to dissolve in water. Before using a cleaning sponge on any object or surface, sprinkle it with baking soda. Using a little warm water, wipe down the greasy surface.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">\n<h2><b>Rice water<\/b><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you read that correctly. Because rice water is starchy and acidic, it dissolves oily particles and is therefore extremely effective in removing stubborn oil stains. Soak the greased kitchenware for 5-10 minutes in rice water. Take them out and wash them in hot water before wiping them dry.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These five solutions should help you get tough grease stains off any item or surface in the kitchen. However, for a quick and easy fix, you can use our Abro oven cleaner to wipe off grease stains on your oven and our grease dissolver for other surfaces.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Grease stains are something you can&#8217;t avoid in the kitchen because they are usually caused by oil or butter splatters, butter and other fatty foods.
