So you try again and again at bringing the car to life but to no avail.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having a dead battery is a terrible way of starting a day; worse, getting stranded with such in an unfamiliar place or the middle of NOWHERE can be immensely dangerous.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike your phone and other gadgets, you can&#8217;t quite know how much battery you have left in your vehicle until your car begins to malfunction. Usually, a charged battery is supposed to last you through at least three to four years; however, several factors can drain your battery before the expected end of its service life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, before they fail, batteries usually give out a few warning signs to get a replacement battery as soon as you can. These signs are not limited to just the electrical system but can cause various drivability problems. In this post, we&#8217;ll cover the most common telltale signs your battery shows when it&#8217;s failing so you can act fast or wait until you &#8220;get caught out in the cold.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dim Headlight<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your car battery is a vital source of power for every component of your car. It powers your vehicle&#8217;s electrical parts and accessories, from your car&#8217;s computer, ignition system, lights, radio, and more; thus, when it fails to generate power because of its weak\/dead state, these accessories won&#8217;t be able to draw enough energy to function anymore. Take, for instance, your car headlight; if you notice that such lights are going dim or even flickering more frequently than usual, it&#8217;s a sign that your battery may be suffering from lack of power.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hard Start&nbsp;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to your engines, your battery is the lifeblood of your vehicle. A battery is integral in powering all of the electrical components in your ride; it is also needed for starting your engine. We often assume that starting a car is as easy as only turning a key or pressing a button, but it goes way beyond that \u2013 it involves your battery doing all the heavy lifting. When you turn on the key, the ignition sends a signal to the battery that kicks off a chemical reaction under the hood of your car. Such response turns into electrical energy that gets the engine cranking and the starter motor running. Without a fully-functioning battery, you&#8217;ll be heading nowhere with no lights and nothing playing on the radio. So on a good day, your car usually starts as you turn on the car key in the ignition. However, if the battery is failing, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to completely energize the start, which will fail to start the engine. In such cases, a heavy and challenging clicking noise would be heard, confirming the difficulty in charging up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: in such scenarios, most people often jumpstart their cars to bring a dead battery back to life, but only for a short term. It is a tip you can apply when you&#8217;re stuck somewhere with a dead battery, but it isn&#8217;t a long-term fix and shouldn&#8217;t be relied upon for too long!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The battery indicator is lit on your dashboard.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The battery indicator light can mean almost anything, including a signal of your battery&#8217;s poor health. You can also visit your car&#8217;s manual for insight into your car&#8217;s warning light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More Issues behind the hood:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Your battery connectors are corroded<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your battery fails, there&#8217;s every likelihood it will be visible. One such sign is the ashy substance on the battery metals, which is a sure sign of corrosion.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A rotten smell<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The smell in the car could mean a wide range of issues, one of which is a dead battery; as soon as you pop the hood of your car, the smell of rotten eggs is more likely to ooze out.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Swollen case<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your battery isn&#8217;t rectangular, there&#8217;s a problem. When your battery case swells and cracks, chances are high that it isn&#8217;t working correctly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, when you see these signs, it is recommended that the best time to replace such a battery is at that period before it finally packs up. Why not stop by the nearest QuickLane NG to get a new battery or have your battery tested to see if it&#8217;s working at total capacity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You are running late or heading for that important meeting; getting into your car and turning the ignition, your car makes that dreadful &#8220;clicking&#8221; noise, but you are not giving up on it yet.
