According to Stasia Mitchell, Entrepreneurship Leader at EY (Global Growth Markets), \u201cthis was the first time we asked the people to vote on the award winner who most inspired them. The voting was meant to be a fun, engaging way to get to know the class of 2020 better\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>He stated further it was no surprise that Dr Maduka and the Coscharis brand stood out so clearly. \u201cThis continues to show how inspiring you and your story are to so many around the world and it says a lot about how valuable your mission is. I can\u2019t wait to meet you in person.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An obviously elated Dr. Cosmas Maduka, President\/CEO Coscharis Group, says, \u201cI have utmost respect for all the finalists from different countries because each of us has a unique story to tell that resonates&nbsp;with the audience. It must have been a very difficult journey for the judges to arrive at their decision and we have to respect it because they have their criteria set. At the end of the day, if I had a choice, I would have given the global award to Dr. Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw still like the judges did.&nbsp; It is really not easy to contend among men and she must have done something much better than the rest of us that stood her out in the mind of the judges.&nbsp; I therefore congratulate her and all the finalists this year.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sequel to Dr Cosmas Maduka\u2019s emergence as the winner of Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2020 award for the West Africa region, he officially joined the \u201cEY World Entrepreneur of the Year\u201d Class of 2020 along with 46 other exceptional entrepreneurs from 41 countries across the globe.
