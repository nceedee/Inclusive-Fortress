In his words, Eric Osagie, the Managing Director of The Sun Publishing Limited, &#8221;we felt strongly that Dr Cosmas Maduka duly deserve this special award based on the fact that within a short time of diversifying into agriculture, the Coscharis Rice brand name has become an house hold name within the agro &#8211; allied sector. This really gave the judges an easy task to give him this award based on his dynamism within the business terrain having virtually conquered the auto world, now doing well in agriculture&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Osagie stated that \u201cCoscharis Group, has grown in leaps and bounds. It is now one of Nigeria\u2019s fastest growing conglomerates, with interests spanning manufacturing, ICT, petrochemical, autocare and auto components, automobiles sales and services, agriculture and agro-allied business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He enthused further that Dr Maduka is an ardent adherent in the Nigerian project despite its harsh operating environment. \u201cYou have continued to venture and invest. Sometimes, one wonders what drives you. At the time when some investors are going away, you are investing more and more.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>According to Abiona Babarinde, the General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Coscharis Group, this award is yet another valuable confirmation of the massive impacts and believe Dr Maduka have had on the Nigerian economy and beyond using the Coscharis brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About Coscharis Group<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Group is a conglomerate with investments in cars assemblage, automobiles sales and services, autocare and auto components distributorship, ICT, petrochemical, , agriculture and agro-allied business across Nigeria, Gabon, Cote D\u2019Ivoire and Ghana.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; Dr. Cosmas Maduka, President and CEO of Coscharis Group, one of Nigeria&#8217;s leading conglomerates was recently recognised as the numero uno Investor of the Year in Nigeria during the recently held Sun Award 2017 ceremony in Lagos.
