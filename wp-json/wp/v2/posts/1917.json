They love being able to go anywhere \u2013 outdoor sports, adventures in nature, and weekends away with the family.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The ideal car for this lifestyle has to be tough enough to handle the elements and terrain, but safe enough that dad feels comfortable taking the whole family on the adventure. This Father\u2019s Day, Ford Motor Company of Sub-Saharan Africa would like to give dads four reasons why the Ford Ranger is the perfect vehicle for the job:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Complete Control <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Rain, dirty roads, steep hills, gravel, muds and rocks \u2013 all these conditions can reduce traction and cause cars to skid or get stuck.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Ford Ranger tackles these risks by increasing your control through its Traction Control (which can be toggled between 4&#215;2 and 4&#215;4) and Locking Rear Differential. While these features were designed to allow the Ranger to traverse the roughest of terrain, you are safe in the knowledge that, at the push of a button, they increase your control on the road at any time.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>More Than Braking <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Ranger has an anti-lock braking system (ABS), but because the Ranger is made for taking on the world its brakes are not used only for stopping.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">When going down a hill, the Ranger\u2019s Hill Descent Control manages the vehicle\u2019s speed while brake pressure is applied to the wheels independently for maximum traction. All this without the driver having to touch the pedals.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Off-road conditions often call for constant and hard braking, the Ranger\u2019s brakes are made of durable and lightweight materials that do not weaken under high temperatures or when carrying a load.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Size and Strength <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Ranger has a ground clearance of 230mm and 800mm of water wading depth*. It is designed to go over mountains, through jungles and rivers, so it will keep you safe from any imperfect roads, debris, or unexpected potholes when you are on your way to work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Off-road driving also puts severe pressure on the body of the car. The Ranger was designed to twist over uneven ground, and makes use of an ultra-high-strength chassis and forgiving yet responsive suspension to ensure a smooth and reliable drive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><strong>Safety Gear <\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Naturally, the Ranger has the typical safety features such as Electronic Stability and airbags. It has many airbags: duel front, drive knee, side curtain and side seat are standard on all Ranger XLT models.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">The Ranger also meets the strictest standards with a 5-star Euro NCAP safety rating. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s tough, and it could be one of the safest cars you will drive.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">This Father\u2019s Day, if you are looking for an adventure, why not let the Ranger take you there? With its ability to take on nearly any terrain while keeping you and your family safe, the Ford Ranger will help you get the most out of your journey and take on the world with confidence.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">*4&#215;2 Hi Rider and 4&#215;4 models only, maintaining a steady speed of not more than 7km\/h.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Four Reasons Why Dads want a Ford Ranger for Father\u2019s Day<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":1918,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"om_disable_all_campaigns":false,"ngg_post_thumbnail":0},"categories":[2],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1917"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1917"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1917\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1924,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1917\/revisions\/1924"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1918"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1917"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1917"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/coscharisgroup.net\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1917"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
