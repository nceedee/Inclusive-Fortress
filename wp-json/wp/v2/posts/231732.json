Quite durable in nature, wooden furniture is often designed with serious staying power and timeless relevance in terms of \u201caesthetic appeal\u201d \u2013 they never go out of style; from tables to chairs, woods are always featured in our homes, farmhouses, business places, office space and often used in exotic locations e.g Royal palace.

Just like your upholstery, woods are made of diverse types; you could have mid-century modern with a light or dark finish or an option with a more traditional set-up, having great bones. Sometimes, when we try to dust off the grim, we are left with several shiny streaks \u2013 this can be frustrating. At other times, we find out that the grime or dirt can\u2019t be removed.<br \/>\nUnlike the Upholsteries, which covers you may wipe with a sponge or wash with a device, there are a number of terms that get tossed around when it comes to wood furniture maintenance.

Dust! Dust!! Dust!!!<\/strong><br \/>\nDust is everywhere, hiding the beauty of everything it lays on. Not only is dust liable to build up a layer of film on your wooden furniture, it could also pose threats to your health via allergies. Most of us are guilty of spreading accumulated dust by using a dry cloth on the surface of the wood when cleaning \u2013 however, this scatters the dust in the air where it\u2019ll float before landing back on the surfaces you just cleaned.

Wipe<\/strong><br \/>\nAvoid cleaning your wooden furniture with water, especially if such wood has a plastic coating. However, you can wipe out sticky spots on the wood with soap and water \u2013 this doesn\u2019t mean you wash like you do with cloth covers. Simply soak a piece of cloth in water mixed with mild detergent, squeeze to near dryness then wipe the affected area on your wooden furniture. After that, rinse and dry with another (dry) soft cloth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#3. Polish<\/strong><br \/>\nWith an ABRO Furniture Polish, you give your wooden furniture a protective layer that protects your wood when exposed to a certain temperature. Avoid using olive oil because oily polish would leave your surface more slippery, making it more liable to attract more dust.<br \/>\n** If you find a repugnant mold of fungi on your wood, you should do this:<br \/>\na. Use the soft brush attachment in your vacuum cleaner to pick up bacteria.<br \/>\nb. Dip a cloth in water mixed with detergent; wring such cloth to nearly dry, then wipe the area<br \/>\nc.
