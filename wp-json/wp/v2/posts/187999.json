The BMW X7 builds on the\nclass leading comfort, handling, safety and technology of all the previous BMW\nX Sport Activity Vehicle model lines that have been produced at Plant\nSpartanburg since 1999.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2019 BMW X7\noffers standard three row seating for 7 with optional Second-row Captain\u2019s\nChairs offering a more exclusive seating arrangement for 6.

The BMW X7 blends\npresence, exclusivity and spaciousness with the versatile and agile driving\nproperties customers would expect from a BMW Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV). The\nnewest and largest model in the BMW X line-up uses outstanding powertrain\noptions and chassis technology, plus generous levels of space in each of its\nthree rows of seats, to deliver unparalleled experiences for the driver and\npassengers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansive\nexterior dimensions of the BMW X7 take luxury to a new level. At 203.3 inches\nin length, 78.7 inches wide and 71.1 inches tall, and with a wheelbase of 122.2\ninches, the X7 displays harmonious proportions and establishes itself as the\nnew head of the BMW X model family. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BMW X7 Interior: More space for an exclusive\nambiance<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The impressive\nopen expanse of the BMW X7 interior brings a new sensation of three rows of\nseats that treats the driver and passengers to an exceptional feeling of\nroominess within the X7\u2019s elegantly appointed interior surroundings. Expansive\nsurfaces and clean structures give the instrument panel a modern look and its\nlines flow smoothly into the door panels. Large trim surfaces framed with\nelectroplated accents on the instrument panel and center console enhance the\ninterior\u2019s elegant and exclusive aura.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two\npassengers in the third row can settle into full-size seats that are fully\ncapable of accommodating adult passengers over longer journeys. Comfort levels\nhere are enhanced by an additional rear glass sunroof panel, cup holders and\narmrests integrated into the side panel trim. The standard second row\nconfiguration offers seating for three. Alternatively, two extremely\ncomfortable individual Captain\u2019s Chairs can be specified for the middle row as\nan option. These comfort seats offer the same range of adjustments as the seats\nfor the driver and front passenger. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The individual\nseats for the second row also feature integrated armrests and comfort cushions.\nTwo second-row seats with a space between them represent a first for a BMW SAV\nand create an exceptionally luxurious ambience in the rear compartment.
