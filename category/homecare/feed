										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The benefit of using starch on clothes is to give them a crisp and clean appearance. Spray starch is usually applied during the ironing process, which is easier. However, a downside to regular starch usage is that it reduces clothing life by breaking down the fabric. Two fabrics are not advisable to use Spray starch on</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Silk:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid spray starch as it can result in a starch spot on the fabric and make it unnaturally hard.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Linen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Avoid using starch as it can make the fabric unnecessarily hard.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, Spray Starch works better with cotton and cotton blend fabrics. Let’s delve into clothes Spray Starch works best for.</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Dress Pants: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crease is visible down the middle of both legs. Spray Starch helps maintain the crease over time. Spray the starch on the crease, let it absorb into the fabric and iron in medium heat.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Dress Shirts: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you notice, the dress shirt collar loses its shape over time due to laundering. But, this is where the Spray Starch works best to prevent the collar from falling flat.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BONUS TIP</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always make sure your cloth is clean before application of Spray starch</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iron the fabric on medium heat to seal the starch into the material.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid using Spray starch regularly and use a minimal quantity</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spray Starch works best with cotton and cotton blend materials.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The world has gone way past the era of just using fragrances in your home when you have guests or using them simply as a way to fight off bad odours. Scents are now as much a part of the decor of a home as nice wallpapers and fancy tapestries. Your home not only has to look expensive, but it also has to smell expensive too. The sense of smell is one of the strongest senses. According to a study found in the </span><a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/02/how-scent-emotion-and-memory-are-intertwined-and-exploited/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harvard Gazette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, because the olfactory bulb, the portion of the brain which recognizes odours, is housed in the limbic system, scent can affect one&#8217;s mood. Emotions and memories are also housed in the limbic system. Smells deliver relevant signals from the olfactory bulb to the brain&#8217;s emotion and memory centres.&nbsp; This is also why, once you smell a flavour and aroma, it can suddenly transport you back to a favourite pastime. Specific scents could also give a person more energy or help them relax. This tells us quality scent in the home can help leave a lasting impression on your guests. Also, having your home smelling nice can help you de-stress and help liven your mood,&nbsp; increase the quality of sleep, and productivity levels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now We’ve established that scents are good for the home and liven it up,&nbsp; let’s discuss what type of scents are most suitable for different areas of the home. You may be wondering; “Why&nbsp; can’t I just use one scent for the whole house?” This would not be ideal because different rooms in the home have different functions and those functions dictate the best scents to use in them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is a breakdown of some of the scents you can use for different rooms in your home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>Bedroom</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jumia.com.ng/organic-air-freshener-strawberry3pcs-abro-mpg1593852.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strawberry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a sweet and luscious scent that can be used in the bedroom, the strawberry scent is said to have calming properties that can help alleviate depression. Lavender and other sweet floral flavours are perfect for the bedroom because they are relaxing and refreshing.&nbsp; According to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3612440/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scientific research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, lavender is the most well-known and widely researched fragrance which has proven useful for reducing blood pressure and improving the heart rate to help you fall asleep better and keep you relaxed throughout the night. Use a fragrance with whiffs of rose, orange, and </span><a href="https://www.jumia.com.ng/strong-scent-organic-air-freshner-vanilla-x-3-pieces-abro-mpg1593865.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">vanilla</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to promote sensuality as well.</span></p>
<h2><b>Kitchen</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The kitchen is where a lot of the heavy lifting gets done in the home. Hours on end may be spent in the kitchen cooking up different meals hence based on the Aroma’s generated it is usually advisable to use Citrus-based scents such as lemon, lime, grapefruit, and tangerine that are cheery and fresh. With the added benefit of masking unpleasant odours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing flavourful or sugary scents will clash with the smells produced from the food and seasons in the kitchen and create an unpleasant mix that just might spoil your appetite. Placing herbs in the kitchen, like rosemary, is also a smart option because they can be used in cooking and have a pleasant scent.</span></p>
<h2><b>Bath Room</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A blend of sweet, floral scents such as </span><a href="https://www.jumia.com.ng/abro-extra-strong-jasmine-scent-air-freshener-x-3pieces-79432762.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">jasmine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grapefruit, bergamot, orange, mandarin, and lime will work wonders for bathrooms. These scents will keep your bathroom smelling fresh and clean, as well as mask and lock in unpleasant odors. Other suitable scents are oceanic, breezy, earthy scents, vibrant herbal blends, and tropical fruit fragrances.</span></p>
<h2><b>Living Room</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your living room, you can use any scent that you feel suits your personality. Breezy, tropical, sweet, earthy, oud, anything works as long as it’s a smell you are comfortable with. You may choose to use a scent that reminds you of a memory or a person or you can use strong scents that can make a lasting impression on guests. You may even decide to mix up different scents to create your unique blend. Fruity scents such as green apple, grapefruit, and pomegranate are sweet and relaxing. While richer and deeper scents like amber, ginger, blackberry, and almond can make your living room feel warm and welcoming.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s movie night, popcorn in one hand and a drink in the other one. The tension gets intense, and you hurriedly try to sip from your glass but it spills onto the couch. This isn’t time for cleaning, so you dab with a piece of clothing and resume your screen time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no denying; we are all guilty of this and are likely to do better if we had some handy couch cleaning tricks we could rely on whenever we have an “accident” whilst using our couch. Across all the household fittings, your couch is probably the most used.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Relatively big and comfortable, your couch gets a lot of action every day; from eating, to sleeping, to some “Netflix and chill’; all of which may leave stains or make it a little colony of crumbs, attracting household insects. No doubt, this big comfy furniture is a household go-to item, but can it count on you to clean up after it’s done supporting you through the good and bad days?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cleaning your sofa might look like a lot of trouble since you can’t just toss it into the water, wash and call it a day. However, you can give your couch the cleaning it truly deserves by learning these effective couch cleaning tricks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trick One: Always begin by vacuuming the Couch</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The number one thing to do when you want to clean your couch is to use your vacuum cleaner on it &#8211; Yeah! You heard right. Take out time to vacuum the entire couch thoroughly; this will enable you to remove leftover crumbs, dust, lint, dirt, and hair/fur, especially if you have a pet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trick Two: Wipe Couch down thoroughly</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To effectively wipe out the stains and dirt, all you have to do is to soak a sponge into the water with a small amount of detergent, squeeze and make it slightly damp so the liquid doesn’t flow entirely into the furniture. After that, you wipe your cushion cover with the sponge. Then follow this by giving your cushion cover a quick revival with scents from a trusted air freshener. We recommend tropical scents for cloth-based furniture in living areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trick Three: Wash the Couch covers consistently</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are going with the second option of washing, then you&#8217;ll have to find out if the couch cover materials can be washed in your washing machine. This is because couch covers are made with different materials, some might be of cotton nature while others may not. So, if you persist in using such a device to wash it, it could get damaged. If the texture of the covers is washable, then you unzip your cover and insert it in cold/lukewarm water mixed with a no-dye detergent to protect your colors. After this, wash at a low heat level, to prevent shrinking; thereafter, you dry in the drier for the shortest duration possible. However, if the cover isn&#8217;t washable, then we recommend you go back to the first option: scrub it with your sponge and spray with an ABRO Air freshener.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trick Four: Drying and Scent Management</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do not dry your covers all the way; slightly damp is best for inserting foam into casings easily. You can then air dry while on the couch with a spray of the ABRO organic air fresheners. Remember to let your couch covers dry out completely before anyone jumps back on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning from the couch tricks above will help save time and effort in maintenance at home or work. It’s time to roll up your sleeves and give that couch the cleaning it truly deserves!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wood is quite different from the upholsteries in your home or office space. Quite durable in nature, wooden furniture is often designed with serious staying power and timeless relevance in terms of “aesthetic appeal” – they never go out of style; from tables to chairs, woods are always featured in our homes, farmhouses, business places, office space and often used in exotic locations e.g Royal palace. It’s everywhere.<br />
Due to its nature, most of us find it quite easy to clean unlike the upholsteries – we simply wipe with a duster or piece of clothing when the wood furniture shows signs of dirt or grime on it! Easy, little effort, and time-saving. However, it might be complicated to clean your wood furniture effectively sometimes. Just like your upholstery, woods are made of diverse types; you could have mid-century modern with a light or dark finish or an option with a more traditional set-up, having great bones. Sometimes, when we try to dust off the grim, we are left with several shiny streaks – this can be frustrating. At other times, we find out that the grime or dirt can’t be removed.<br />
Unlike the Upholsteries, which covers you may wipe with a sponge or wash with a device, there are a number of terms that get tossed around when it comes to wood furniture maintenance. From cleaning to dusting, polishing, waxing; all of which are done to keep the wood spotless and looking its best. Although a lot of people have their diverse opinions on how to clean and care for your wood furniture, the cleaning technique you use depends on the exact piece you own but here are some simple steps to take that are relevant to all types of wooden furniture:</p>
<p><strong>#1. Dust! Dust!! Dust!!!</strong><br />
Dust is everywhere, hiding the beauty of everything it lays on. Not only is dust liable to build up a layer of film on your wooden furniture, it could also pose threats to your health via allergies. Most of us are guilty of spreading accumulated dust by using a dry cloth on the surface of the wood when cleaning – however, this scatters the dust in the air where it’ll float before landing back on the surfaces you just cleaned. The proper way to dust is to capture the dust in one place then you dampen a piece of clothing, using it to wipe it down!</p>
<p><strong>#2. Wipe</strong><br />
Avoid cleaning your wooden furniture with water, especially if such wood has a plastic coating. However, you can wipe out sticky spots on the wood with soap and water – this doesn’t mean you wash like you do with cloth covers. Simply soak a piece of cloth in water mixed with mild detergent, squeeze to near dryness then wipe the affected area on your wooden furniture. After that, rinse and dry with another (dry) soft cloth.</p>
<p><strong>#3. Polish</strong><br />
With an ABRO Furniture Polish, you give your wooden furniture a protective layer that protects your wood when exposed to a certain temperature. Avoid using olive oil because oily polish would leave your surface more slippery, making it more liable to attract more dust.<br />
** If you find a repugnant mold of fungi on your wood, you should do this:<br />
a. Use the soft brush attachment in your vacuum cleaner to pick up bacteria.<br />
b. Dip a cloth in water mixed with detergent; wring such cloth to nearly dry, then wipe the area<br />
c. Rinse and immediately dry with a soft, clean cloth</p>
<p><strong>BLOG IV</strong><br />
<strong>CARE TIPS FOR YOUR WOODEN FURNITURE</strong><br />
Your wooden furniture is an integral part of home/office décor – undoubtedly your house or office will look incomplete without it. From our night stand to bedframe, dining table, bookshelves etc.; these wooden furniture often provides order and decency to your items.<br />
Asides its ability to ensure order, it is one of your assets that can last you a lifetime; its durability is structured in such a way that it can be transferred to your kids and many more generations to come, if properly taken care of. With immense care and attention, you can keep them looking their best for years of enjoyment without need for repairs. Here are a couple of tips on how you can manage and ensure your wooden furniture lasts long and is looking its best for years to come and through multiple generations.</p>
<p><strong>#Tip 1: Protect your wood</strong><br />
Most of us are guilty of using hot items directly on the surface of these woods; this could cause loads of damage – one that could make you make you discard it. You need to always protect your wood with coasters, trivets or holders when setting hot things on it. You could also use tablecloth or decorative placemats to protect your table from hot spills.</p>
<p><strong>#Tip 2: Dust Often</strong><br />
One of the chores no one likes is dusting but it’s one great way to keep your wood from having buildups from airborne particles. Frequent dusting with a piece of soft clothing will enable you to reach areas of the wood that can attract and hold dust so damages can be prevented.</p>
<p><strong>#Tip 3: Treat Wear and Tear</strong><br />
Your wooden furniture is something that you use all the time – most likely more than anything else in your home/office. As a result, they are bound to sustain injuries &#8211; face wear and tear. For this reason, it is quite important that extra caution should be given when it comes with your furniture. No doubt, there would exist scratches and incisions but in using products like the AbroGard Clear Wood Lacquer, you can treat and hide these cuts and restore the inherent beauty of your wooden furniture. However, if the damage on the surface is too wide to be treated with a polish, then you might need to resort to painting it – this will give it a new outlook and keep it durable for more years</p>
<p><strong>#Tip 4: Avoid exposing it to harsh environment</strong><br />
Heat, sun and cold can wreak damage on your wooden furniture; therefore, avoid placing them in front of cooking fire, naked lights, uncovered windows and vents as all of these could release certain bacteria that could cause havoc on the wood.</p>
<p><strong>#Tip 5: Ensure you clean your wood frequently</strong><br />
It is necessary that you engage in some cleaning so your wood does not get damaged completely. Dusting is cool but it isn’t enough. Be sure to follow up the tips I recommended for effective cleaning of your wood furniture (link to the previous blog post)</p>
<p><strong>Final tip</strong><br />
Sometimes, your wooden furniture can become overly dry; in this instance, you’ll need to re-oil it by applying the ABROs on your furniture. Also, you can sprinkle the surface with some ABROs Air Freshner to keep it smelling fresh and make your furniture good as new.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Grease stains are something you can&#8217;t avoid in the kitchen because they are usually caused by oil or butter splatters, butter and other fatty foods. They are difficult to wipe off and can be tricky to clean. Grease stains affect any part of the kitchen like the walls, your cookware, kitchen utensils, oven or grill, plates, kitchen napkins.&nbsp; They may also stain your sinks and taps from splash accidents while cleaning kitchen utensils. Outside vegetarian, grease stains will be commonplace as it&#8217;s associated with staple food items such as soy sauce, mayonnaise, butter, bacon, fat, ham, etc, so understanding techniques for handling them is knowledge that can be very handy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be tough to get grease stains off any item in the kitchen. This is because water alone will not remove grease seeing that water molecules do not adhere to grease molecules. Human muscle and dedication alone are unfortunately not always enough to remove caked grease from a well-used kitchen. Commercial grease cleaners like our Abro oven and grill cleaner can handle most messes, but what else can you do if you cannot afford any products at the moment? Fortunately, there are ways to combat grease stains using items you already have around the house. These are the top five home remedies for removing kitchen grease below.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h2><b>Lemon, ash, and vinegar</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acidity of the lemon and vinegar will help to break down the grease stains. If oil stains have been allowed to fester and harden,&nbsp; lime and vinegar will dissolve the surface due to &nbsp; their acidity. Ash, especially wood ash, contains lye which when smeared on grease dries it up and cuts it off leaving your surfaces good as new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Making a paste of ash, lemon, and vinegar is the simplest way to restore the luster of your copper vessels. Now rub this paste all over the vessels and wash them in hot water. For best results, leave the utensil in the paste for 2-3 minutes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h2><b>Laundry Detergent in Liquid Form</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liquid laundry detergent is another good solution for cleaning oil and grease stains because it contains various chemicals and properties created expressly to breakfor the purpose of breaking down oil and stripstripping it off materials. When you use liquid detergent on greasy surfaces it cleans the oil off effortlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like with dish soaps, sprinkle a generous amount of detergent onto the object and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing. If the stain is on clothing, leave the detergent on the item while loading it into the washing machine for extra cleaning. If you are attempting to remove stains from upholstery, this is a great method to try before attempting to clean it with harsh chemicals that may ruin it, because laundry detergent is gentle while still very effective.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h2><b>Salt and Rubbing Alcohol Solution</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dehydrating properties of Salt work to dry up oil and lift it off materials while rubbing alcohol breaks down oil and causes it to evaporate from materials. Alcohol dries almost instantly so you don&#8217;t have to worry about leaving a wet stain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Application</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is simple to know what to do if grease gets on your shirt or other clothing items, but kitchens can contain other types of fabrics that cannot be washed. For non-washable fabrics such as rugs, chair covers, and carpets, mix 1 cup of salt with four portions of rubbing alcohol (you can use measuring cups or spoons to measure it out). Rub the solution on the stain with a cloth until it lifts off with the cloth. After the grease has been removed and your solution has dried, sweep away the excess salt and wipe away any salt marks with a damp cloth.</span></p>

<h2><b>Baking Soda and water</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baking soda can be used to clean up stubborn grease stains on walls, cookware, clothes, and utensils. Baking soda works wonders with cleaning grease because it is a mild alkali that causes dirt and grease to dissolve in water. Before using a cleaning sponge on any object or surface, sprinkle it with baking soda. Using a little warm water, wipe down the greasy surface.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">
<h2><b>Rice water</b></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, you read that correctly. Because rice water is starchy and acidic, it dissolves oily particles and is therefore extremely effective in removing stubborn oil stains. Soak the greased kitchenware for 5-10 minutes in rice water. Take them out and wash them in hot water before wiping them dry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These five solutions should help you get tough grease stains off any item or surface in the kitchen. However, for a quick and easy fix, you can use our Abro oven cleaner to wipe off grease stains on your oven and our grease dissolver for other surfaces.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As fun and exciting as cooking can be, the aftermath is usually a messy kitchen full of dirty utensils. In this part of the world, we have people over a lot and host parties as often as we can for every occasion. It&#8217;s always fun to have people over and have a nice time. However, after all the fun and festivities you&#8217;re often left alone to wash up the piled-up dishes and clean your dirty utensils. When faced with such situations you contemplate throwing some utensils away because you&#8217;re not sure how to get some of the burnt and other stubborn stains off them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we&#8217;ll be exploring all the methods you can employ to clean your kitchen utensils and keep them sparkling. Washing utensils doesn&#8217;t have to be a daunting process, it can be easy and seamless once you know the right thing to do. We&#8217;re going to give you a breakdown of how to wash kitchen utensils with baking soda, how to clean wooden kitchen utensils and, how to sterilize them for maximum safety.</span></p>
<h1><strong>Cleaning Kitchen Utensils by Hand</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>Step 1: Wipe off Leftover Food</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leftover food on utensils will contaminate the cleaning water, making the cleaning process less productive. Clean off any big chunks of food stuck to the utensil with a napkin or tissue. Don&#8217;t bother yourself with small stubborn stains that refuse to wipe off. They will come off when you wash the utensils.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Step 2: Fill your Kitchen Sink with Hot Water</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Plug your sink and pour hot water in. Add approximately 1 tablespoon of liquid soap into the water as the sink fills up. Read the label of the dishwashing liquid bottle to determine the proper amount of liquid to use, as some cleaning products don&#8217;t require you to use that much.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 3: Add Baking Soda to the Mix</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Baking soda is a perfect addition to the mix because it&#8217;s an excellent natural cleaner. It aids in breaking down stains and removing bad odors. For extra cleaning power, mix two tablespoons of baking soda with the water and dishwashing liquid.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 4: Soak the Dirty Kitchen Utensils</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soak the dishes to soften the stubborn stains and make them easier to wash off. You can put in the utensils that are very stained last so the water doesn&#8217;t get too dirty.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 5: Scrub Each Utensil</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Place the utensils inside the sink and clean them with a dish brush or sponge. Scrub each utensil until all the food is removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are different types of Dish Washing Brushes and Sponges (link to the post)</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 6: Rinse each Kitchen Utensil</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After washing the utensils, thoroughly rinse them with running water from the tap. Make certain that all cleaning agents are completely removed.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 7: Dry the Utensils</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Allow the utensils to air dry or dry with a lint-free dish towel. Return each utensil to its proper place after drying. Alternatively, leave the utensils to dry naturally on the drying rack. This option is simple and prevents stainless steel utensils from becoming splotchy. If you air-dry your utensils, make sure they are not stacked on top of each other because this will prevent the air from transferring and drying them.</span></p>
<h2>
Cleaning Wooden Utensils</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wooden utensils can be harder to clean than their stainless steel counterparts, they also retain odors, both good and bad so they require more care. Here is a step-by-step process for cleaning your wood utensils.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 1: Scrub with Hot Soapy Water</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a scrubbing brush to remove food particles from your wooden utensils, then wash with a dish sponge or brush and soapy water. Don&#8217;t worry if there are stains left after the initial wash.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 2: Apply Salt, Lemon, and Baking Soda to stains</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lemon has acidic components that help eliminate all odors when paired with salt it scrubs off most tough stains. Cut a lemon in half then add salt to the surface of one of the lemons. Use the lemon and salt to scrub the wooden utensils, if there are still some stains left you can use baking soda and lemon juice to get them off.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Step 3: Rinse</strong>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once you&#8217;re done with the cleaning process, rinse off all residue with water. Make sure you rinse off all the cleaning agents.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Step 4: Dry Utensils In the Sun</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally sundry your wooden utensils to lighten stains, keep them fresh, and eliminate all odors. It should take about one hour for them to completely dry. If it&#8217;s not a sunny day you can air-dry inside the kitchen.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood is quite different from the upholsteries in your home or office space. Quite durable in nature, wooden furniture is often designed with serious staying power and timeless relevance in terms of “aesthetic appeal” – they never go out of style; from tables to chairs, woods are always featured in our homes, farmhouses, business places, office space and often used in exotic locations e.g Royal palace. It’s everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to its nature, most of us find it quite easy to clean unlike the upholsteries – we simply wipe with a duster or piece of clothing when the wood furniture shows signs of dirt or grime on it! Easy, little effort and time saving. However, it might be complicated to clean your wood furniture effectively sometimes. Just like your upholstery, woods are made of diverse types; you could have mid-century modern with a light or dark finish or an option with a more traditional set-up, having great bones. Sometimes, when we try to dust off the grim, we are left with several shiny streaks – this can be frustrating. At other times, we find out that the grime or dirt can’t be removed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike the Upholsteries, which covers you may wipe with a sponge or wash with a device, there are a number of terms that get tossed around when it comes to wood furniture maintenance. From cleaning to dusting, polishing, waxing; all of which are done to keep the wood spotless and looking its best. Although a lot of people have their diverse opinions on how to clean and care for your wood furniture, the cleaning technique you use depends on the exact piece you own but here are some simple steps to take that are relevant to all types of wooden furniture:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>1. Dusting wooden Furniture</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dust is everywhere, hiding the beauty of everything it lays on. Not only is dust liable to build up a layer of film on your wooden furniture, it could also pose threats to your health via allergies. Most of us are guilty of spreading accumulated dust by using a dry cloth on the surface of the wood when cleaning – however, this scatters the dust in the air where it’ll float before landing back on the surfaces you just cleaned. The proper way to dust is to capture the dust in one place then you dampen a piece of clothing, using it to wipe it down!</span></p>
<p><strong>2. Wiping Down Wooden Furniture</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid cleaning your wooden furniture with water, especially if such wood has a plastic coating. However, you can wipe out sticky spots on the wood with soap and water – this doesn’t mean you wash like you do with cloth covers. Simply soak a piece of cloth in water mixed with mild detergent, squeeze to near dryness then wipe the affected area on your wooden furniture. After that, rinse and dry with another (dry) soft cloth.</span></p>
<p><strong>3. Polishing Wooden Furniture</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With an ABRO Furniture Polish, you give your wooden furniture a protective layer that protects your wood when exposed to a certain temperature. Avoid using olive oil because oily polish would leave your surface more slippery, making it more liable to attract more dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">** If you find mould of fungi on your wooden furniture, you should do this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use the soft brush attachment in your vacuum cleaner to pick up bacteria.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dip a cloth in water mixed with detergent; wring such cloth to nearly dry, then wipe the area</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rinse and immediately dry with a soft, clean cloth</span></li>
</ol>
<p>These three basic steps and their implementation techniques are key in ensuring&nbsp; you are able to prolong the life of wooden furniture in your homes and offices whilst ensuring you maintain a healthy living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy cleaning&#8230;</p>
