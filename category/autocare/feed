										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Nigeria, the rainy season can be frustrating for road users, especially car owners, due to bad roads, traffic jams, and constant waterlogs. Unfortunately, the bad roads and drainage systems do not make it easy for vehicle owners.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of these challenges, there are several precautions you can take to maintain and preserve the value and longevity of your vehicle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These safety precautions are guaranteed to keep yourself, passengers, other road users, and your car safe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><b> Fix or Change your wiper</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The wiper is frequent during the rainy season, unlike the dry season, where it is not used frequently. It is essential to check your wiper because it is made of rubber which can wear out quickly. It can result in scratches or uneven cleaning of the windshield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Direct the airconditioner flow to your windshield to reduce the appearance of fog to enhance visibility</span></p>
<p><b>BONUS POINT: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep your wiper liquid filled to the brim</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b> Check your headlight and Tailights</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear visual is your primary goal during this period, although the heavy downpour can make this a challenge. But, with your headlight and taillight in good condition, you are good to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunlight causes your headlamps to get cloudy; this is why regular cleaning is vital to maintain its proper function.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check for cracks and breakages to ensure water does not enter the headlights and cause unwanted fuses. If your light flickers when it is turned on, this is most likely a sign of changing its bulb.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b> Check your batteries</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Car battery issues are usually the most frequent problem motorists face during the rainy period leaving motorists stranded due to humidity and droplets splashing during this time. Therefore, if there is a greenish white powdery around the terminal of the battery, this is a sign of corrosion which can make the power to the car unstable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can leave the car hood open to avoid direct heat damage to the battery. Although a radiator helps cool down the system, leaving the car hood open makes the cooling process faster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><b> Check your car brakes</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose there are any unusual sounds while braking, it is crucial to get it checked and fixed by professionals.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, During the rainy period, brakes take a while to work adequately because water reduces friction between the tires and the road, which does not allow the car to stop at the appropriate time. This means overspeeding should be avoided to protect yourself and other road users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><b> Line Car Floor with Plastic Footmat of Old Newspaper</b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A plastic foot mat or newspaper can save the stress of maintaining the vehicle&#8217;s interior from mud, moisture, and the damp smell, which is usually challenging to eliminate.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Other Tips</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roll windows up</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carry spares, e.g., tires, battery, fuse, cables, etc</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maintain proper distance from vehicles ahead of you</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always use headlights and taillights for better visual</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rusts – Not only are they ugly, they also result into take a toll on a lot more than your car’s appearance. From an ominous brown color stain on the fender or at the edges of your car, they can lowers the value of your car by eating away at the structure, ruining its functionality and costing you some money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This unsightly ugly color unfortunately forms much more quickly than they are removed: with oxygen, water and road salt combining at the surface of any aspect of your car, they form, signifying the breakdown of iron-based materials on such a surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several kinds of rust that can develop on your car’s edges and surfaces. Surface rusts are likely to form when your car is constantly exposed to the Sun’s UV rays. Such exposure has the tendency to break down your car’s paint over time. Damages such as scratches, scrapes, dents and even bird droppings can make your car rust. In this instance, surface rust are removed using high-grade sandpaper or an abrasive wheel to grind it down until the paint and rust are gone, and shiny metal is exposed</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, when this rust is left untreated, it begins to expand and continues going deeper, creating “scales” and exposing the metal underneath and leaving holes in your car. Unfortunately, at this point, every option for correcting the problem won’t have an effective result. In most cases, you’ll need to have the entire panel replaced or have the corroded areas cut out and have patch panels welded into place. If the frame of your car is rusted, this will damage its structural integrity, making it unsafe to drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, rusts can be largely avoidable. All you have to do is know how to prevent it effectively so you don’t waste money, time or get frustrated. Below are the precautionary steps that can help prevent rust in your car:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong> &nbsp; </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Wash your car regularly&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is like the simplest and general way of preventing rust. Although it might sounds simple, this step can make a huge difference in preventing rust. Washing your car once a week will help remove salt buildup and dirt on your car surface. This will reduce wear and tear by protecting the coat and paint layers from damages that might makes it easier for rust to sneak its way in. Therefore, ensure you regularly wash the exterior of your car and also the undercarriage of the car, including the wheel wells and bumpers.</span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> &nbsp;Always keep an eye on the paint coatings.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a car owner, it’s important to know that won’t stay in the same condition as the day you drove it from the dealer. Its beauty will deteriorate with time and the paints will get damaged over time. Once your car is open to water, to be specific – and rust can begin to form. However, by keeping an eye on the paint job or small spots of rust, you can quickly ensure timely care and proper maintenance which will keep its overall appearance intact.&nbsp; Pay close attention to the condition of drain holes, water channels, and seals because once moisture collects here, rust can start to form unseen.</span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;<strong>Regular Waxing Habits</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ensure you wax your car at least twice a year. This is beneficial as it keep your car in the best possible condition such that your paint becomes new while your car gets an additional layer of protective barrier against harmful UV rays.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Mop as it spills</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be guilty of neglecting spills on the carper of your car. However, the longer you neglect it, the more detrimental it becomes to your car. Spills often sink into the metals of your car thereby causing a rust. You may not realize on time but the damage would have been done. So when next you spill a drink onto the floor of your car, make sure you clean it up immediately!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Protect Your Car from the Elements&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </strong></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way to avoid rust is to prevent constant exposure of your car to sun or rain rather, ensure you park it under cover; more like a shade or garage. This cover will also protect it from bird drippings, which have certain chemicals that destroy the paint job and leave scratches for the rust to set in.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other tips</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid parking your car close to other cars in a car park</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid placing heavy stuff on the roof of your car</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try as much as possible to prevent driving over potholes and roads that are under construction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Avoid parking over gutters or areas where water is gathered as water can get to the car bottom and causes rust, weakening it from the outside)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are running late or heading for that important meeting; getting into your car and turning the ignition, your car makes that dreadful &#8220;clicking&#8221; noise, but you are not giving up on it yet. So you try again and again at bringing the car to life but to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a dead battery is a terrible way of starting a day; worse, getting stranded with such in an unfamiliar place or the middle of NOWHERE can be immensely dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike your phone and other gadgets, you can&#8217;t quite know how much battery you have left in your vehicle until your car begins to malfunction. Usually, a charged battery is supposed to last you through at least three to four years; however, several factors can drain your battery before the expected end of its service life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, before they fail, batteries usually give out a few warning signs to get a replacement battery as soon as you can. These signs are not limited to just the electrical system but can cause various drivability problems. In this post, we&#8217;ll cover the most common telltale signs your battery shows when it&#8217;s failing so you can act fast or wait until you &#8220;get caught out in the cold.&#8221;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dim Headlight</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car battery is a vital source of power for every component of your car. It powers your vehicle&#8217;s electrical parts and accessories, from your car&#8217;s computer, ignition system, lights, radio, and more; thus, when it fails to generate power because of its weak/dead state, these accessories won&#8217;t be able to draw enough energy to function anymore. Take, for instance, your car headlight; if you notice that such lights are going dim or even flickering more frequently than usual, it&#8217;s a sign that your battery may be suffering from lack of power.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hard Start&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similar to your engines, your battery is the lifeblood of your vehicle. A battery is integral in powering all of the electrical components in your ride; it is also needed for starting your engine. We often assume that starting a car is as easy as only turning a key or pressing a button, but it goes way beyond that – it involves your battery doing all the heavy lifting. When you turn on the key, the ignition sends a signal to the battery that kicks off a chemical reaction under the hood of your car. Such response turns into electrical energy that gets the engine cranking and the starter motor running. Without a fully-functioning battery, you&#8217;ll be heading nowhere with no lights and nothing playing on the radio. So on a good day, your car usually starts as you turn on the car key in the ignition. However, if the battery is failing, it wouldn&#8217;t be able to completely energize the start, which will fail to start the engine. In such cases, a heavy and challenging clicking noise would be heard, confirming the difficulty in charging up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: in such scenarios, most people often jumpstart their cars to bring a dead battery back to life, but only for a short term. It is a tip you can apply when you&#8217;re stuck somewhere with a dead battery, but it isn&#8217;t a long-term fix and shouldn&#8217;t be relied upon for too long!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery indicator is lit on your dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery indicator light can mean almost anything, including a signal of your battery&#8217;s poor health. You can also visit your car&#8217;s manual for insight into your car&#8217;s warning light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">More Issues behind the hood:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Your battery connectors are corroded</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your battery fails, there&#8217;s every likelihood it will be visible. One such sign is the ashy substance on the battery metals, which is a sure sign of corrosion.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A rotten smell</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The smell in the car could mean a wide range of issues, one of which is a dead battery; as soon as you pop the hood of your car, the smell of rotten eggs is more likely to ooze out.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Swollen case</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your battery isn&#8217;t rectangular, there&#8217;s a problem. When your battery case swells and cracks, chances are high that it isn&#8217;t working correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, when you see these signs, it is recommended that the best time to replace such a battery is at that period before it finally packs up. Why not stop by the nearest QuickLane NG to get a new battery or have your battery tested to see if it&#8217;s working at total capacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing that comes to your mind when you buy a new car is probably the model, brand specifications, features, and capacity, among others. No doubt, these details are significant markers of a car, but other significant markers are often overlooked. These include the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), also known as the Chassis Number of your car, and the Engine Number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These details, which are equally relevant, if not more, might seem unimportant while purchasing a new or a used car. However, these elements are like the DNA of your car, shedding light on the manufacturing and registration details of a car. Not only do they play a critical role during its purchase or sale, but they also aid in buying online car insurance or locating the motor insurance particulars of your car. Since these numbers aren&#8217;t in the limelight, they seem pretty challenging to locate and, thus, be ignored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VIN is like a unique 17-digit alphanumeric identifier for your car, more like the vehicular equivalent of a thumbprint, exclusively allotted to your car by the manufacturer. These codes distinguish your car from other models and are used by registration authorities to register your car. This code can also be utilized to track your car if it gets stolen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your car chassis number reveals essential information about the vehicle, including its year, country of manufacture, its make, engine type, etc. Each number of your car&#8217;s 17-digits VIN signifies a critical detail about the vehicle, some of which have been listed below.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The first number of the VIN is the car&#8217;s production location</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The second and third numbers are the particulars of the car&#8217;s producer;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth number is the vehicle&#8217;s category, namely car, bike, etc.;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The tenth number is the year in which the car was manufactured;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The last six digits of the VIN: the car&#8217;s unique serial number.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where can the VIN code be found?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several parts of your car on which the VIN code is imprinted, and these parts include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The dashboard on the driver&#8217;s side;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the hood of the car near the engine;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Beneath the spare wheel in the car&#8217;s boot;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under the front grille of the car;</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The driver&#8217;s side door.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind that different car manufacturing companies often opt for different car parts to imprint the code upon. Thus, you can find your car&#8217;s VIN on its body and also find it on the car&#8217;s registration certificate as well as the car insurance policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bonus:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside your VIN code is the engine number of your car, which is equally important. Usually, your car Engine Number is found printed on the outer covering or engine casing of the vehicle&#8217;s engine. Like the car&#8217;s chassis number, the engine number is used for identification purposes, but they are not the same, i.e., they are two different but unique numbers. Often, car manufacturers ensure that the number is visible and easy to locate when you open the hood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the engine&#8217;s casing, your car&#8217;s engine number can be found in the following manner:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The registration certificate of your car</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The insurance policy for your car</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The car owner&#8217;s manual</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact your car dealership</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a car owner, one of the ‘never-good’ signs that your car may exhibit is a small puddle of oil underneath your vehicle when it is parked. It indicates many things, one of which is a gear oil leak. Usually, it forms a grease stain on your garage floor or driveway, but most importantly, this leakage can cost you a lot of money if nothing is done about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A gear oil leak isn’t the same as an engine oil leak from your car engine. Leakages from the gearbox are often caused by a lot of things ranging from</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bad seal or gasket, loose/missing bolts or nuts,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A crack in the case somewhere, or</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">a couple of other reasons, of which you need to ascertain which one is prevailing in your scenario. Moreover, as oil continues to flow from the gearbox, it contributes to maintenance costs and the environment due to the obvious safety risks involved with exposing everyone to the gear oil.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, the first thing to do is find the leak and determine the cause before coming up with a quick fix or deciding on a repair like a complete replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are temporary options that can mitigate such leaks, all thanks to technological advancement in the industry. These solutions aren’t proper fixes but simple patches that can reduce the damage of such leaks. What is needed to stop such a leak is to take down the machine and repair it. However, you can implement these solutions below until the gearbox is taken out of service and properly repaired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of such quick fixes for gear oil leakage is adding compound matter to the gear oil. This act aids to “Band-Aid” such leakages. Similar to the radiator sealant, these compounds form deposits at the point of leakage when introduced to the oil. However, it would be best if you did this only after careful consideration and testing to ensure that there will be no ill effects on the oil or gear itself. Alongside the compound deposits are fluids and pastes known as seal enhancers, which are produced with synthetic bases, causing the seal material to swell. With such swells, the leakage reduces. Another quick solution for gearbox leakages is grease filling, filling the gearbox with grease. By doing this, the gears get lubricated effectively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note that after adding anything to a component other than the appropriate lubricant, it should be removed and the interior surfaces flushed to eliminate all risks of cross-compatibility. When the machine can be taken out of service, the seal should be replaced and the gearbox flushed to remove any traces of the sealing compound that has been introduced. All seals should also be replaced to reduce future leakage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s always advisable to speak with a professional technician about issues surrounding gear oil leakage to avoid any household injuries from unaided exploration of your car engines!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our lives are governed by our ability to have in-depth knowledge about every aspect of life itself – from our health, safety, and investments; we make findings to gain a background understanding, so we aren&#8217;t left at risk. This explains that research is paramount in every aspect of our lives – your car inclusively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just like everything else, your car has its secrets, and if you don&#8217;t know where to find the truth, they can cause you a lot of grief. Thus, studying your vehicle history reports provides you with a wealth of data about your car, from its damage history to its maintenance records. This information provides you with knowledge and insights to guide you when purchasing such a vehicle, so you enjoy more years of reliable and safe transportation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Vehicle Health Report is a visual inspection of every aspect of your car, i.e., the tires, brakes, wheels, exhaust, steering, wiper blades, as well as crucial fluid levels. This report provides diagnostic, maintenance, and recall information so you can stay on top of your vehicle&#8217;s requirements and be alert of possible problems. This way, it becomes easier for you to make an informed decision about any potential issues that might occur in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does the Vehicle Health Check cover?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Lights / Electrics Checks: Mandatory lights (external); Horn/wipers / washers</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">External / Internal Checks: This includes Brake noise / feel, Seat belts – security &amp; operation, Clutch / transmission operation, Glass / mirrors / wiper blades, Engine noise / smoke</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Under Bonnet Checks: Fluid levels (oil, water, coolant, screenwash), Fluid leaks (oil, water), Battery condition/drive belts</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Brakes / Hubs Checks: Brake fluid condition / temperature, Master cylinder / servo, Linings – pads / shoes, Discs / drums, Hoses / pipes / cables / wheel bearings</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Underside Checks: Exhaust system/catalyst, Steering/suspension, Driveshafts/gaiters, Oil leaks</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheels / Tyres Checks: Nearside front, Offside front, Nearside rear, Offside rear, Spare, Tire pressures</span></li>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fluid Checks: Coolant, Brake fluid, Screenwash, Engine oil</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The VHC information also aids buyers of used cars to make informed purchasing decisions. This is because the report contains some of the information listed below:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Airbag deployments: This shows lingering issues with the vehicle, especially if it was involved in a severe accident in the past. Information details the condition of the frame, drivetrain, or electronics, i.e., if these parts, especially the airbags, were repaired and re-inspected properly.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a normal day; the hustle has begun, and traffic builds up. You’re driving down the highway, minding your own business, when suddenly, something smashes into your windshield, directly in your line of sight – Whack! You didn’t see what caused it, but as your heartbeat returns to normal, you are faced with a new reality</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having a cracked windshield will disfigure your car. The big question here is, what can you do when your car’s windshield gets cracked? Would you be without your car for a day or two while dealing with the glass shop, or would you deal with it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cracked windshield is like a cracked mirror or phone screen – it isn’t pretty, neither is it usable and if proper caution isn’t taken, such cracks could lead to the replacement of the entire windshield. Cracks in the windshield are the most common maintenance issues people have with their car. There are several ways your car’s glass can get a crack – it could be a deliberate or accidental action caused by all manner of debris, nuts, rocks, bolts, or birds flying up from the road. Also, the crack level varies from tiny chips to larger cracks, making it difficult for you to continue driving your car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus, this article is a knowledge giveaway on what to do and how to handle the crack on the windshield! The first step to handling your windshield crack is to measure and determine the extent of your windshield damage. As stated earlier, there are small and large cracks, so you should identify the extent of the damage done. This is important as it ascertains your next step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the crack on your windshield is less than three inches, then there are a couple of solutions that would save you from replacing the windshield. The solutions fall under two categories in the instance where the crack is within a three-inch frame. You can stop the crack from spreading further into the glass by following any of the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apply ABROs Flowable Silicon Sealant onto the affected areas of the glass.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use a windshield repair kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions: If you attempt to use a repair kit on damage more extensive than recommended, it might result in a compromised windshield. With a compromised windshield, you wouldn’t be comfortable driving since your line of sight when driving will be disturbed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limit parking your car directly under sunlight exposure – Although this cannot be avoided entirely, you can limit the number of times it is parked under the sun</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of how small the crack is, you should take immediate action on your windshield cracks to avoid the build-up of dirt in the crack, which will make it quite challenging to work on it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if it’s more than 3 inches, then the damage is substantial such that the location of the crack tends to affect your vision while driving. Therefore, it needs a professional repair or a complete replacement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In such an instance, it’s recommended that you talk to a rep at any of our Quick Lane branches for solutions or glass specialists that repair cracked windshields with chemical processes. If you go with a repair option, such action tends to almost wholly take away the crack on your glass, and it feels like magic because it is glass.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a repair isn’t possible, this calls for a replacement. In this instance, such damages occur during collisions or deliberate shield smashing; making a windshield replacement is the last resort. Professionals only do replacements because of the technicalities involved in removing and calibrating several sensors attached to car windshields. In this instance, please do not attempt to do it yourself to avoid the glass from crushing or cutting into your skin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a repair or replacement is done, kindly inspect the interior part of the car by spraying a large volume of water on the glass from every angle. By doing this, you’ll ensure that there are no holes in the windshield.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driving with a cracked windshield isn’t safe nor is it attractive. You should give your car the immediate attention it needs; you either stop the crack yourself or meet a professional so you can make the most of your driving!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It all begins with a few problems popping up for a brief moment – Flickering gauges, dimmed headlights, stalling, then strange growling noises and an odd smell. It might seem your car is haunted, but that’s false; it’s most likely a failing alternator, and if such isn’t given its due attention on time, the failed alternator may lead to the death of your car.<br />
You might have heard or know what the alternator is all about, and you probably know it’s a key component in your Vehicle’s electrical system. But what does it do? The alternator plays a vital role in your Vehicle’s operation such that it keeps the battery of your Vehicle fully charged so you can successfully turn on your car and use electronic accessories such as your radio and headlights. How does the alternator do this? It turns the energy from the crankshaft into practical electricity through induction that powers your Vehicle’s electrical systems and keeps your battery fully charged. Hence, it provides the power needed to start the car.<br />
Because the alternator is critically connected to other vehicle systems, it can drastically affect the car’s life. However, you can prevent this from happening by paying attention to the signs below to make it a little easier for you to diagnose car trouble caused by the alternator.<br />
The indicator light<br />
Your car most likely has a dashboard warning light titled “ALT” or “GEN.” that alerts you to a problem with your alternator. These lights are often the first indicator that something is wrong with your alternator. They are triggered when the output of your alternator drops below a certain level.<br />
Be on the lookout for this warning light even if you are not experiencing any problems.<br />
The trouble with the Headlights<br />
Another strong signal that your alternator may not be working correctly is flickering, pulsating, or dimmed headlights. Your alternator provides energy to all accessories, including the headlights; thus, when it begins to fail, it won’t be able to power your headlights effectively, causing instability.<br />
Other electrical failures<br />
Just as with your headlights, a failing alternator will cause the failures of other electronics of your car; from power locks to windows, air conditioning, internal lighting, etc., these will operate at a slower speed than average or stop working altogether.<br />
Strange noises and smell<br />
Usually, many things can cause noise and smell in the car, so this might seem vague or harmless. But when you begin to have alternator problems, you’d notice unusual rattles that may result in growling or whining noises coming from under the hood of the car. These noises are also accompanied by the foul odor of burning rubber or wires, which is an indication that the alternator is frayed or being overworked, causing them to heat up unsafely and emit a foul odor.</p>
<p>Car stalls or has difficulty starting.<br />
Your car needs some power to ignite the gasoline in your engine regardless of if it’s running on gasoline. If there isn’t enough power to keep the spark plugs and engines alive, then you’d have trouble starting the car. Usually, the sign starts with a starting trouble or a stall while running, but if this sign is ignored, then your car eventually won’t start at all. Although several other mechanical issues can cause stalling or hard starts, you should always keep a sharp eye and be aware of what the symptom means so you can pinpoint the problem. Get your alternator checked before you get stranded.<br />
Dead Battery<br />
Sometimes, your car battery fails on its own, but a bad alternator can lead to the death of your battery. Once your alternator fails to give power, it fails to recharge your battery, and that can cause the battery to drain. If your battery is already dead, it is recommended that you have the alternator checked before replacing the battery, so you don’t have to go through the same problem twice.</p>
<p>The alternator plays a critical role in the operation of any gasoline-powered vehicle because there’s a need for energy to power the Vehicle &#8211; this is in contrast with electric vehicles. Lots of energy is provided for the Vehicle’s normal operations since such cars are driven by an electric motor and battery combination.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to car usage and maintenance, car brakes are an important part that must not be neglected. Driving around with bad brakes can be very hazardous, leading to brake failures and ultimately, accidents. Hence regular brake servicing and sometimes, replacement is advised. Thankfully, more often than not, before brakes go on to fail, they give warning signs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, let’s look at 5 warning signs that your brakes are worn and due for servicing or a change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Brake Light On:&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this may be normal if your parking brake is engaged, your brake light shouldn’t be on when your parking brake is not engaged. If your brake light appears on your dashboard without engaging your parking brake, this is an indicator that you need to get your brakes checked. It may just be your brake system warning light, or your car&#8217;s way of letting you know that you have a problem. The Antilock braking system (ABS) warning light on your dash is a strong indicator that you need to get your car to a repair shop.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Squealing, Squeaking or Grinding Noises:&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you start to hear a metallic noise or squealing sound when you apply your brakes, this may mean that it is time to change your brake pads. Being made of steel, your brake pads making contact with your rotor is what gives off this sound. While this may not seem an imminent problem, you are better off changing the brake pads immediately as further wear could lead to damage to your rotor which is more expensive to repair. Grinding noises could be an indicator that you’ve allowed your brake pads to wear completely. This is not a good sign as it could mean that your rotor is already getting affected. You should look into it immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Vibration, Wobbling When You Brake:</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your steering wheel starts to wobble or if you feel a vibration when you apply your brakes, then you want to listen to your brake system – it has a message for you. These vibrations could be an indicator that your rotor is uneven and needs to be checked. It could also be that your brake caliper is not releasing properly. Another cause may be that your brake components are damaged. When you feel these vibrations or wobbles when applying your brakes, it simply means it is time to visit a repair shop like the Quicklane auto repair shop by Coscharis.</span></p>
<h2><b>Leaking Fluid:&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When your brake fluid begins to leak, it is time to replace your master cylinder. Your braking power comes from the hydraulic pressure between your master cylinder and the brake lines. So, if you’re experiencing a leakage, this could affect your braking power and ultimately cause a brake failure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Spongy or Soft Brake Pedal:</b><b>&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you apply your brakes and notice a lower resistance in the brake pedal, then you need to service your brakes immediately. Soft or spongy brake pedals are indicative of air or moisture in the braking system or a faulty master cylinder. Whatever the case may be, your brakes need urgent attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Any of these signs implies it’s time to change your brake system or pads to avoid risk to safety while driving and while avoiding damage to other car parts dependent on the brake pads.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hardly does anyone like plunking down money to shop for new sets of tires; this is because It takes time and costs money.&nbsp; Regardless of the size of the vehicle, tires are a huge investment that can last as long as possible.&nbsp; However, longevity is based on regular care and maintenance of the tire tread, tire pressure, wheel balance, alignment, and rotation.&nbsp; These maintenance habits tend to extend the life of your tires and improve your car&#8217;s ride so your car can run as efficiently as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s a look at some quick maintenance tips that can make your tires last longer and improve your safety on the highway today;</span></p>
<p><strong>Practice Good driving habits</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your driving habits come first in having a stable tire.&nbsp; Fast starts, fast turns, and speeding and fast stops tend to cause more tire wear.&nbsp; These acts also heat the rubber and cause a faster breakdown.&nbsp; This also includes the apparent acts such as bumping and slamming speedily into curbs, potholes, logs, and rocks.&nbsp; These incidents might not puncture the tire, but constant scraping and slamming against curb and potholes will constantly wear down the rubber until it eventually gives out &#8212; probably sooner rather than later.</span></p>
<p><strong>Regular Check-Up</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, most damage done to car tires goes unnoticed, and it&#8217;s not until the tire begins to fail that most car owners notice the crack, leak, or puncture.&nbsp; However, you can proactively recognise these damages by inspecting the tires every few weeks for such damage.&nbsp; Once the damage is noticed, you can get your tire repaired before it fails.&nbsp; Look out for bulging pockets on the sidewall, Nails and screws, Gouges and scrapes on time so you can repair it on time.&nbsp; This is a critical component of extending the life of all your tires.</span></p>
<p><strong>keep up with your wheel balance, rotation, and alignment services</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever noticed your steering wheel vibrates or the car seats shake when your vehicle reaches speeds of 60-70 miles per hour (mph)?&nbsp; If this occurs, then there&#8217;s a problem with your tires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wheel alignment, tire balance, and regular tire rotations are vital maintenance requirements that will maximize your tires&#8217; life and provide a safer driving experience.&nbsp; For instance, the wheel balance has to do with how each tire sits to the vehicle.&nbsp; Usually, these tires become unbalanced due to the typical wear and tear or from driving in rough road conditions.&nbsp; On the other hand, wheel alignment refers to the tires&#8217; relation to one another; thus, it is essential in keeping the vehicle driving straight and balanced.&nbsp; Otherwise, the vehicle will pull to one side, with excessive wear on either side of the tire.&nbsp; Quite similar to balance and alignment, keeping up with tire rotation for every 7,000 miles will ensure all four tires are wearing down evenly.&nbsp; For every tire rotation, it is recommended that you also check your wheel alignment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stay On Top of your Tire Pressure</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another great way to extend the life of your tires is to check your tire pressure every couple of weeks.&nbsp; Naturally, Tires lose a little bit of air over time, especially during the cold season, but it fluctuates midway into the fall and spring, making it necessary to do a check a little more often.&nbsp; Checking it lets you maintain the correct air pressure to decrease wear and tear and reduce the risk of a blowout.</span></p>
<p><strong>Keep Your Tires Clean</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tires are naturally tough, but you should take the time to occasionally clear the rough debris, mud, sand, and gravel from your tires to reduce the wear on the tire surface, which could affect their ability to stay firmly on the ground in an emergency. Consider a budget friendly and credible product such as the <a style="color: red;" href="https://abro.com/product/siliconized-tire-shine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abro Siliconized tire shine</a>&nbsp; after washing your tires to prevent dirts from accumulating on the surface once you get back on the road.</span></p>
<p>Millions of cars ply the road daily, and regardless of their size or brand, they have one thing in common -tires to ride on.&nbsp; These tires come in different kinds; some are small, plain, and inexpensive for passenger vehicles, and some are big, expensive as a 24-inches with flashy rims.&nbsp; What matters is how durable these tires last up for you, and it all comes down to how you intentionally maintain them because even the cheapest tires can last long if you imbibe healthy maintenance habits to them.</p>
